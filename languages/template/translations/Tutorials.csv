#Combat Tutorials,
Charging,
Moving at least 2 tiles in a straight line before performing an attack allows characters with a Melee weapon to perform a Charge Attack,
Charge attacks significantly increase your likelihood to hit,
Charge attacks add a bonus to your hit chance depending on how far you manage to move before attacking,
The teal pips over the character indicate how much momentum is built up by the charge,
"The more momentum, the bigger the charge bonus",
A successful charge will give the following text printing the bonus that was added to the character’s To-Hit roll,
Tactical View,
Pressing SHIFT in combat brings up the tactical overlay and makes it easier to see the exact positioning of characters and the underlying grid,
"In the settings menu, you can toggle the tactical overlay to be always on during the player’s turn",
Holding LEFT TRIGGER in combat brings up the tactical overlay and makes it easier to see the exact positioning of characters and the underlying grid,
Conditions,
You have contracted a disease from your fight with the rats,
You may see what conditions are affecting you by opening the Character Sheet,
Click your portraits or press ‘C’ to do so,
Not all conditions are negative!,
Press the Y BUTTON to do so,
Negative conditions can often be cured by magic or rest,
This disease can be cured by a potion,
Pick up and equip the lantern to search the area!,
Hint,
Some containers are hidden until your character “spots” them,
Difficulty,
Warda is a dangerous place where you can quickly end up facing very dangerous beings,
Sometimes the best tactic is to leave a fight for later as you level up and gather more equipment and allies,
Remember that you can change the difficulty of the game at any time,
You can even create your own custom difficulty!,
Play the game the way YOU want it!,
Flanking,
A character can be Flanked if opponents occupy the tile above and below it or to the left and right of it,
It is much easier to hit a Flanked character,
A Rogue will automatically Backstab Flanked targets to deal massive amounts of damage,
Here the main character has moved to the right of the mercenary,
And then Roland moves to the left of the mercenary who is now Flanked,
Note the red double-arrow icon that indicates when a character is Flanked,
Initiative,
"In combat, characters act in order of initiative",
You can view the initiative order by using the Initiative Widget on the left side of the screen,
Moving the cursor over the widget makes it pop out,
Note that moving the cursor over a name will make that character's outline flash on the battlefield,
Injuries,
Your character is critically injured!,
This means you have taken enough damage to reduce BOTH your Vitality and Wounds,
The green bar under your Character’s portrait represents your Vitality score,
Vitality is a buffer to your wounds and as long as you have Vitality left you won’t take (serious,
Wound damage,
Vitality is easily lost and easily regained!,
Potions and healing magic restores Vitality - even during combat,
"The second, purple bar represents your Wounds",
Losing Wounds is much more serious than losing Vitality,
Reaching 0 wounds means your character falls unconscious,
Wounds can also only be recovered by resting (or leveling up,
Try to avoid taking Wound damage at all costs!,
"Whenever you take Wound damage, you gain an Injury Condition as indicated by the icon on the portrait",
Injuries confer serious penalties to your character and can only be removed by resting,
A party full of injured party members has its combat effectiveness severely reduced!,
Making camp and resting is the surest way to restore an injured character!,
Note that resting is not possible in every location so plan accordingly,
You can also rest at inns when you find them,
Interactables,
Moving the cursor over an interactable object will make a yellow outline appear,
Left mouse-click to interact with the object,
Right mouse-click to examine it,
Use RIGHT TRIGGER to interact with and object and press LEFT TRIGGER to examine it,
Holding down SHIFT will highlight all interactable objects in view,
Some objects are hidden and won't be highlighted until they are spotted,
Holding down LEFT TRIGGER will highlight all interactable objects in view,
Inventory,
"If you've not already done so, you must equip a weapon",
Press 'E' to manage your equipment,

Double click on items to use them,
For weapons and armor this means the item becomes equipped,
Equipped items are moved to the relevant equipment slot,
"Select an item and press the A BUTTON to ""use"" it",
Note that you can also press RIGHT TRIGGER with the cursor over a selected item to use it,
Movement Points,
The widget on the lower right side represents the character’s action points,
The yellow pips represent Movement points,
The violet pips represent Attacks,
You can move a number of tiles each combat equal to your Movement Points AND Attacks,
But spending Attacks to move means you won't be able to attack that turn,
This is a good way of moving extra far,
Performing an attack will clear out all remaining movement points,
"In other words, attacking will end the character’s turn in most cases",
New Character,
You’ve added a new character to your party!,
"Press ""Q"" or the character portraits to swap the party leader",
Press RIGHT BUMPER or the character portraits to swap the party leader,
The current leader’s Attributes are used for tests outside combat (such as for Awareness or Stealth,
Familiarize yourself with the Attributes and Abilities of your party members and have the right character take the lead depending on the circumstances,
"When a new member joins your party, they Level Up to your current level",
The “Level Up” icon on your party-member’s portrait shows that a character is ready to level up!,
Double-click the character portrait and select FEATS to begin leveling up,
Press the X BUTTON and go to the FEATS tab to begin leveling up,
Stealth,
Press the Hide button to go into Stealth mode,
The action buttons also map to the numerical buttons,
You may also press LEFT JOYSTICK to enter stealth mode,
While in stealth mode the Stealth indicator becomes visible,
A yellow indicator means you're in danger of being spotted,
"While your indicator is yellow, it will count down to 0%",
When it reaches 0% you are spotted and will become visible,
Moving in lit areas and being close to other characters will make the counter go down very fast,
Stick to shadows and avoid other characters,
Your ability to stay hidden is dictated by your stealth skill,
Increase this skill to stay hidden for longer,
Wearing armor makes it harder to stay hidden,
"If the indicator turns green, it means you are no longer in danger of being spotted",
"Spending time in ""green"" areas will refill your stealth meter",

You also need to select Camp Activities for your party members,
These provide bonuses based on your character's skills,
Beds and Inns,
Keep an eye out for beds or inns to rest in while adventuring,
Doing so is superior to sleeping in the wild,
"While resting at an inn or in a bed, you have the option to manage your party!",
"This means you can choose what characters get to be part of your main party, and who should wait in camp",
Camp followers do not earn XP and never participate in combat,
Camp followers will for the most part not engage in the narrative,
"There are a few exceptions to this however, and there are some cases where even characters outside your main party may chime in during conversations",
