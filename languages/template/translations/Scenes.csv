#DeadSmugglerJournal,
I hate these jobs,
Dropped off and told to guard the cargo until the next ship picks you up,
And in this bloody cave no less,
I sometimes think the Imperial dungeons would be preferable,
Read on,
Leave,
We spent some time exploring the cave today and it seems there is a side tunnel,
"It's blocked off but if we had a pickaxe, I'm certain we could clear in with ease",
Bryn says the area gives him the chills and that we better keep away,
Coward!,
Golden dead!,
Bryn got attacked by a crab the size of a warhound today!,
Nearly took his leg off!,
Neither of us have seen anything like it before and we can only pray it was alone!,
Hope the ship won't be delayed much longer,
Bryn is gone,
Tore him up they did!,
No way out and no one is coming for me!,
Light is failing,
Mother,
#IntroSurgeonJournal,
Surgeon's Journal,
Written on the day of departure from mainland,
Left Adler's Helm today with a full cargo of passengers,
Mercenaries by the looks of it,
Paid well,
Ship was dispatched by Guild before we could fully restock medical supplies,
Hopefully we won't need them,
"Then again, our passengers make me uneasy",
Writtern 5 days ago,
Brawl in mess - had to set nose,
Men seem on edge,
"Also, Igan came to me today with a bite-wound that he sustained whilst working in the hold",
Didn't see creature and I would say it was a rat's bite if it weren't for the size and some aspect of the dentition that I find hard to explain properly,
I recommend captain sends detail to capture and kill creature,
Written two days ago,
Was visited today by navigator Aslam,
He asked for Whitefern - a sedative,
Claimed he had trouble sleeping,
"Suspected he was not fully forthcoming and when pushed, he mumbled something about the stars being 'odd'",
Not sure what he meant and he left before I could push him further,
Written today,
Men are about to break,
We cannot maintain our course for Idra,
Captain advised me today to make ready the surgery and to expect casualties,
I suspect he intends to inform our passengers that he refuses to land on the island,
If this is my last,
The entry trails off,

#IntroBerrynGuard,
A guardsman dressed in the livery of the noble house Berryn,
The guard scowls somewhat at you,
Armsmaster Lyra awaits you at the main entrance,
You best talk to her if you've not already done so,
You'll find the kitchen in the eastern end of the courtyard,
The garden and hedge-maze is to the west,
And I needn't remind you that it's a poor idea to enter the maze without a lantern,
Have a good evening m'lord,
Have a good evening m'lady,
#IntroCato,
Cato stands - with poorly concealed effort,
And {PLAYER},
"You stand, and meet his gaze",
Return her to me,
There is no other outcome of this affair,
"Shake his hand, and leave",
"Remain silent, and leave",
"You have my word, Cato",
LEAVE,
Cato Berryn,
"Cato Berryn sits tall in a tasteful, but modest reception room",
He looks less imposing than you remember - and with a few more crow's feet,
"Nonetheless, he's lost none of his composure or air of casual authority",
Continue,
You take a seat across a formidable desk from him,
"This study, like the rest of the villa, is half-lit, giving a morose cast to its opulence",
"The older man's face creases into a tired, but genuine smile, which momentarily lifts some of the room's oppressive mood",
It's a mercy to see you again - your own man and in your prime,
"Cato says, before a frown consumes his smile",
It's just a shame our reunion is overshadowed by the fates of those we love,
"But perhaps, together, we can yet improve our collective circumstances?",
It's a mercy to see you again - your own woman and in your prime,
Why have you summoned me?,
"So, you know my Father is dead",
"Cato leans forward, hands clasped beneath his chin",
I shan't deny it,
I was saddened to hear of his passing,
"Despite everything, I remember him fondly",
You drove him to drink and mercenary work,
No need to dwell on the past,
"Cato leans back again, and his eyes go distant",
He failed in his duties,
"For an arms-master, there is no greater shame than a lapse of vigilance",
He drove himself into exile,
Lyra shifts slightly behind Cato,
"If he failed, then it was never possible to succeed",
Say nothing,
A pregnant pause,
He failed her,
Your father's exile was a sorrow to me,
Yet he could not remain in the household - for Embla's sake,
"The loss of a mother is tragedy enough, without being reminded of it",
Embla?,
Do not hide behind your daughter,
The past is done with!,
Tell me why I'm here!,
That may be so,
But it is done,
I regret his loyalty could not be rewarded,
Sometimes...the tapestry's weave is not so easy to discern,
"Cato's face is still mild, yet you sense his tone hardening",
Fine,
I'm sure we've both moved on,
"By exiling him, you condemned me as well",
Your anger is understandable,
The hardships you must have suffered on the road are written in your face,
"Such is the cost of mercenary work, I suppose",
But do not presume to understand the forces that were at play,
And still are,
"Just tell me why I'm here, old man!",
"Cato is caught off-guard for a moment, before letting out a deep breath",
Then the years have bestoweed you with wisdom,
"I am glad, for it has forsaken the House of Berryn",
Why have you called me here?,
Embla is missing,
"Cato's voice quivers momentarily, betraying his stoic features",
"Now I beg of you, {PLAYER}",
Help me find my daughter,
"Help her return home, where she belongs",
Why me?,
What's happened to her?,
Is it not obvious?,
You've clearly grown to inherit your fathers resourcefulness - and besides - Embla has trusted you since before either of you could speak,
And now the fool has got herself into trouble?,
"She left without notice, a week ago",
"From the scant clues we had, we believe she boarded a ship bound for one of the Outer Isles, Idra",
She went of her own free will,
At the time I thought little of it,
Cato begins to glower,
"Since then, however, there have been 'reports'",
Grave ones,
Reports?,
Something has been building in her for years,
An 'aptitude' of sorts,
But I suspect you already knew?,
"In any case, it's grown much stronger lately and drives her in ways I cannot understand",
I suspect she is looking for... answers,
But why Idra?,
An aptitude?,
What am I to do?,
An aptitude of the worst kind,
It does not spring from the canonical Imperial praxis,
Instead it comes from elsewhere,
It is the kind the Empire does not suffer to exist,
I hope it's only answers that she seeks,
I see,
What can I do?,
Why indeed?,
There is little on the island save the port of Horryn,
"If Idra was her destination, she must have landed there",
Horryn?,
What of her 'aptitude'?,
Yes,
"An old Imperial port and home to a few hundred whalers, traders and the occasional smuggler",
"We can only speculate as to what drew her there, but it's our only lead",
How can I help her?,
You mentioned her 'aptitude'?,
"Hire mercenaries, travel to Idra and begin your search in the port of Horryn",
"From there, I trust you to do what needs be done",
"Spare no cost, just bring back my daughter",
Mercenaries?,
"The man is a grizzled veteran - he may have slowed with age, but his experience and reliability more than make up for it",
He's also much respected by similar men - and so will be instrumental in hiring a reliable crew,
I'll take it into consideration,
"I trust your instincts, but I beseech you consider him - he's no great dinner guest, but he's been irreplaceable elsewhere",
Is that so?,
Very well,
"Cato shows you his upturned palms, beseeching,",
I know this thing I ask of you is fraught with danger,
"But this is your chance at improving your fortune - materially, and in honour",
What say you?,
I accept - for Embla's sake,
Very well - For my family's name,
I'll do it,
For the gold,
What makes you think I care?,
"A chill draught causes a nearby candle to flicker, and you see the cold mirrored in Cato's features",
You are not to blame for the decline in your family's fortune,
But you could be responsible for restoring it,
We'll see,
I will be,
"Cato smiles softly, visibly relieved, and for a moment he looks like the man you remember",
Have you any final questions or matters to discuss?,
"Time is, as I'm sure you appreciate, of the essence",
Let's just get on with it,
"If nothing else, the port will be dangerous enough",
That is why I have summoned a Roland Greyeye to me - a crude but effective sell-sword - that I've made good use of before,
He shall accompany you on this task,
Roland Greyeye?,
I work alone!,
I met the man just before seeing you,
"No one, and no word has left Idra in days",
Rumor has it even the Imperial augurs are in the dark,
"I know not how this touches the fate of my daughter, but she must be returned to me, one way or another",
Any idea why she left?,
#IntroCellar,
Empty bottles litter the floor of this room,
You chuckle to yourself as you imagine the kitchen staff in their wine tasting sessions,
"No doubt, much revelry has taken place here",
Then a cool gust of air from the passage to the north,
The wine cellar lies that way and you can almost hear faint sobbing,
Ghosts no doubt,
#IntroChef,
Ha!,
The old wretch is too cowardly to come himself so he sends you instead?,
The brandy will be the end of him I say,
"Then again, who am I to deny the old fool his few pleasures",
You'll find a crate of fine Gorremian brandy in the north-east corner of the wine cellar,
Hold on!,
Let me see what you made!,
Armand excitedly licks his lips,
Present the Sandwich for inspection,
The chef offers a short bow and a tired but sincere smile,
I am chef Armand and my humble kitchen is at your disposal m'lord,
I am chef Armand and my humble kitchen is at your disposal m'lady,
Sadly I was told of your arrival only minutes ago and my oven must be fired up again,
You must be famished?,
Indeed I am,
Splendid!,
"The pantry is west of the wine cellar, and the cheese is kept in the northernmost room",
Return when you have the cured ham and cheddar and I shall provide bread and instructions,
"Now, venture forth into the underworld!",
Where is the cellar?,
Kydeon has asked me to fetch him a bottle of brandy,
Perfect!,
"First of all, here is some bread",
"Now, the cauldron is quite empty and just warm enough for you to use",
Remember,
"You need both the bread, ham and cheese to make the perfect sandwich!",
"Now, go give it a try and bring me the result!",
I shall see if you have it in you!,
"Chef Armand wanders back and forth, tending the fire and keeping his kitchen tidy",
He has the gait of a man who has been on his feet for far too many hours,
I have the ham and cheese!,
Present the sandwich for inspection,
Where is the cellar again?,
Use the hatch in the floor over there!,
Armand points towards a wooden hatch by the wall,
"It's quite dark down there, but there should be a lantern in a chest near the stairs",
Good luck!,
#IntroMadSailors,
Sailors,
The sailors stare at you wide-eyed and terrified,
Dead Emperors!,
It's coming for us!,
It whispers to me!,
One of them draws a weapon with shaking hands,
Get away from me!,
Calm yourself - You're guild sailors!,
"Half-insane with terror, the sailors scream and lunge at you!",
Attack,
The men stop dead in their tracks - seemingly shocked back from their momentary lapse of sanity by your words,
The pair blinks towards you in a moment of indecision and then stumbles up to the main deck and the tumult that seems to be taking place there,
#IntroMonster,
"You dash towards the ship's fractured rail, dodging holes in the deck and wounded men, beseeching you for help",
Roland hangs by one arm from the side of the ship,
Try to grab him!,
"Before Estavo can smirk in satisfaction, a tentacle whips into the lifeboat, leaving a dark smear against the now buckling hull",
"Looking up, you see the remaining tentacles high above you, poised for the coup de grace",
Abandon ship!,
"You lunge for Roland's arm, but he loses his grip and your fingers close only around thin air - you missed him by an inch",
He falls wordlessly downwards,
You regard the tentacles with morbid fascination,
"Their colouration seems to shift and swim, and their tips are cruelly barbed",
"They sway, almost hypnotically, before crunching into the ship again",
"One of the tentacles narrowly misses you, but the impact sends you flying overboard",
"The impact of the water winds you, the waves pummel you down, the currents beseech you to go deeper",
Ever deeper,
Peaceful blackness,
The Terror of Idra,
"You rest your sword-arm, and survey the carnage",
Then suddenly a loud crash as something collides violently with the hull,
Surviving mercenaries and crewmen alike fight to keep their footing as the ship lurches,
"Suddenly, huge, monstrous tentacles burst from the water around the ship",
"For a split-second, before the terror sets in, you wonder what Estavo must be thinking as the monstrosities loom over him",
"You pace the main deck, as the coast of Idra sails into clear view",
"You may have kept the crew alive, but they're still tense and skittish",
"The ships captain catches your eye, and nods in gratitude",
There is a scream from the crow's nest,
"Momentarily, you understand why - huge, monstrous tentacles have burst from the water around the ship",
You hear the captain cry out in terror as one of them wraps around his leg and plucks him from the deck,
"After reaching their full height, the tentacles curve inwards and smash into the ship",
Some pierce straight through the deck - Others snap the masts like they were matchsticks,
You stand frozen in place,
"Through a haze of splintered wood and panicked screams, you notice Roland",
"He throws himself out of the way of a tentacle, but begins to fall overboard as the ship lurches once more",
Go to Roland's aid!,
Leave Roland to his fate,
"Through a haze of splintered wood and panicked screams, you watch as the tentacles rise for another strike",
You notice a few of the mercenaries are rushing towards the lifeboats,
Join the mercenaries,
Observe the tentacles,
You reach the lifeboat just as the mercenaries begin lowering it into the sea,
Estavo brandishes his sword at you,
I think not,
Get in!,
Estavo bellows,
"If you're ok with doubling our fee, of course",
You watch as he is swallowed by the raging sea,
"The ship is listing fatally - and you see the great tentacles high above you, poised for the coup de grace",
"As you jump, you hear the terrible rending of wood giving in to flesh",
Roland plummets wordlessly over the ship's rail,
"Meanwhile, you notice a few of the mercenaries are rushing towards the lifeboats",
Follow the mercenaries,
...............,
Sink,
#IntroMutiny,
"The mercenary leader, Estavo, flicks his dark eyes to you, but keeps his blade fixed on the desperate captain",
There's a reason he's known as 'Fireblood' to his men,
Estavo,
You'll get your money but let me handle this,
Estavo - enough of the theatrics,
A cruel smile twitches into life on Estavo's wind-weathered face,
There's only one rich noble girl,
But we can always find more sailors,
The ship's captain bristles at these words,
"Captain, why have we not dropped anchor?",
Mutiny,
"You emerge onto the deck, and see two groups of men facing each other with weapons drawn",
The ship shakes violently in the grip of a storm as lightning tears across the sky,
There is desperation in the captain's voice,
We are seasoned sailors - we do not balk at shadows!,
You need to be alive to rescue this girl you speak of!,
We're out of time,
"Sail us in, or argue the point with Estavo",
"You speak sense, Perhaps it is better to turn around?",
Estavo!,
Have at it!,
A few of the ship's crew lower their weapons,
"The captain's eyes flit between you, and Estavo's murderous grin",
"He sheathes his blade and speaks softly, his voice barely audible over the snapping sails",
So be it,
May the deep have mercy,
You gain 300 XP,
Hah!,
Theatrics you say?,
It is not my men who cower like children!,
For what?,
Shadows in the water?,
Shadows will not keep me from my pay!,
I refuse to stand by and let you butcher the crew,
Do as you wish,
Estavo's grin begins to show teeth as he hears your words,
The color drains from the Captain's face,
There is a moment's silence then a crash and a shudder as something strikes the ship's hull,
"In the confusion, a mercenary's throwing dagger flies; lodging in a sailor's throat",
Fight the crew,
"Estavo lets out a short, hoarse laugh",
"Danger, I don't mind",
Working for fools - that's how people get killed,
"Before you can reply, Estavo whistles, and his men charge at you and the ship's crew!",
Fend off the mercenaries,
"Amidst the din of the storm and their frantic arguments, you bellow for the attention of the assembled crewmen and mercenaries",
"Both the ship's Captain, and the leader of the mercenaries you hired - a coarse, thug of a man named Estavo - turn their attention to you",
They look ready to use the unsheathed weapons in their hands at the slightest provocation,
Address the ship's captain,
Address the mercenary leader,
You direct your attention to the ship's captain,
"You know him to be a reasonable, but suggestible man",
"At present, his usually placid eyes are wild with panic - or anger",
I paid you for passage to the shore - did I not?,
Why have we not dropped anchor?!,
"The captain lowers his weapon, and speaks earnestly",
The coast of Idra is cursed!,
"We'd heard tales, and assumed them grog-drenched rumors only - but there is something between us and the shore that will drag us all to a watery grave!",
What are you talking about?,
What have you seen?,
"We must sail on, to land and the girl",
Something dire stalks these shores,
We cannot approach without risking the ire of that horror,
A jittery mutter of agreement rises from the sailors causing Estavo's eyes to darken even further,
What horror?,
Captain!,
Take us closer or there will be consequences!,
Naught but glimpses,
"My men have seen the shadow of something deep in water, stalking us",
Nothing natural moves like that,
Estavo glares murderously at the captain,
You renege on our deal based on a glimpse?,
Foolish superstition!,
Take us in now!,
Do as you wish!,
Estavo turns his steely gaze from you to the captain,
"Let me spell this out for you, sea-dog - we contracted to rescue the girl",
"But if you don't get us to the shore, we'll gut you for free",
The mercenaries you hired all shift their weight in anticipation of making good on that promise,
Captain - he's right,
Do what you were hired to do!,
Convince the man!,
Something changes in the Captain's expression,
He stands tall,
I will not order my ship and my men to certain doom!,
We shall not get any closer to the coast while I have command,
I'm sorry captain,
You leave us no choice,
"I defer to your judgement, captain",
Estavo - stand down,
I believe you - but my contract with these men does not mention your survival,
#IntroRats,
You stop dead as you narrowly avoid stepping in a rust-red puddle,
"The stench of blood fills your nostrils and as you look around in the dim light of the hold, you realize someone, or something fought for their life here",
"The same moment the thought hits you, a hiss sounds from the shadows!",
"You squint towards the shadows as a hunched, feral looking form slowly slinks forwards",
"Tiny, disgustingly human-like hands, yellow fangs and a grotesquely dexterous pink tail leave no doubt of the creature's rodent nature",
"Though as it emerges from the shadows, it becomes abundantly clear that what may have started life as a common ship-rat, has now grown into something that has no right to exist",
A second hiss sounds behind you and the abominations lunge at you!,
#IntroRoland,
Roland,
You emerge onto the ship's lower deck,
As your eyes adjust to the darkness you become aware of a hulking figure standing in the shadows,
{PLAYER}!,
Here at last,
growls a rough voice,
Who’s there?,
Show yourself!,
Freeze and listen carefully,
Lunge at the figure,
Have you lost your bloody mind?!,
Nobody is going to feel calmer for seeing you,
"Until you hear screams, stay here",
You're right,
Follow me!,
"Fine, and be careful - I hear it's bad luck to kill a guild-sailor",
Feeling jumpy?,
the brute growls with a smile,
Roland?!,
Why're you skulking in the shadows?,
You tend to have that effect on people,
Where are we?,
"And you'll regret not stopping our boys from murdering them, if you don't get to the damn deck",
"Besides, we'll need an escape route",
Agreed,
"They deserve disciplining, not death",
Listen,
I've been doing this since you were at the teat,
Let’s go,
For all the good it will do,
"Wait here, Roland",
"There are two doors ahead - take the left, and we should be able to sneak past them without any trouble",
Anything else I should know?,
Famous last words,
"The figure in the shadows twists nimbly past your clumsy lunge, before thick arms wrap around your neck in a vice-like grip",
Your assailant could surely snap your neck in an instance,
"Just as your vision begins to narrow and your legs go limp, he relases you and you stumble forewards before spinning around",
Who's there?,
It’s Roland,
Where the tides have you been?,
Why are you skulking around?,
"Below decks, planning our landing",
Why?,
Mind your own fucking business!,
What's going on?,
The brute chuckles,
Shadows suit a face like this just fine,
No matter,
There is trouble and you’re needed on deck,
Now,
What for?,
What’s all that noise?,
Have we arrived?,
Let's get this over with,
"The island is in sight, but the damn guilders refuse to land",
They want to turn back,
If we turn back - we lose our shot at the girl,
Did they say why?,
Ha,
the old veteran grunts in what passes as laughter for him,
Only superstitious bilge,
They claim they saw something in the water,
"Either way, our boys are about to show them some very real steel",
If we can't land - we lose our shot at the girl,
I knew I'd regret chartering a guilder ship,
And no-one gets paid,
"Listen here, I know our boys better than most",
We've hired them to go to Idra and kill,
"If we don't pay them, things will go bad quickly",
But the sailors are bloody terrified,
They claim something is hunting us,
Wait,
"There're a few sailors up ahead, rattled as a pair of rabbits",
"We're not here to make friends, if that's what you're suggesting",
Is there a way past them?,
Spill sailor-blood and the guild will want to make you pay,
"Take the left door ahead, and spare us some trouble, and a pay cut",
Perhaps,
Anything else you feel compelled to tell me?,
Let's just get off this bloody boat,
"Motioning for you to take the lead, Roland falls in behind you.'",
From above agitated shouts can be heard,
#IntroShipAwaken,
The Zephyr,
"On the wine-dark, raging seas of the Outer Isles, a lone caravel struggles against the winds and waves towards the accursed island of Idra",
The moan of creaking timbers,
The tang of preserved fish,
Your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness of the ship's dimly lit hold,
"Suddenly, something strikes the hull and the ship rocks violently",
Your heart begins to pound and a feeling of unease grows in your stomach,
"Rise, well rested and ready to go",
"Get up, mouth dry and head pounding",
Rouse yourself from deep meditation,
You get to your feet and become aware of agitated voices shouting up on deck,
Something is not right,
You should make your way up top and get a bearing on the situation,
Be on your way,
WARNING,
You are about to skip the intro and go straight to the mainland,
This is for PLAY-TESTING only and it is not the intended experience!,
Never mind!,
SKIP INTRO,
#IntroShipLockedDoor,
A Locked Door,
"To your surprise, you realize that this door has been locked from the outside!",
It doesn't budge - perhaps you could slip the lock with a thin blade or use something to smash it?,
Use Dagger,
Use Club,
"As the door swings open, you can now clearly make out cries from the deck above",
You should make haste,
You slip the dagger through a gap in the door and lift the bar that was locking you in,
The door begins to creak open,
"Using the club, you smash the lock in a fell swoop",
#IntroVilla,
One you recognize immediately,
Valeria Berryn - the mistress of the house,
You remember her as a gray ghost,
Absent and unwell,
The other statue depicts the girl you once knew so well,
"Embla Berryn - daughter of the house, and now a woman grown strong and clear-eyed - her likeness has none of her mother's cowed timidness",
How is mistress Valeria these days?,
How fares Embla?,
The mistress is 'vacationing' in the countryside,
Lyra answers curtly,
And what of Embla?,
Lyra's eyes flicker ever so slightly,
We should hasten to Master Berryn - he's long been impatient to see you,
But what of mistress Valeria?,
Memories,
"The opulence is faded, the shadows longer - clearly much has changed since the last time you were here",
Try to remember how long it's been,
I didn't come here to reminisce,
The Statues,
Flanking the doorway are two marble statues,
"The craftsmanship is stunning, but the sight of the two women depicted fills you with sadness",
Examine them,
"It's been years, perhaps decades since you were here, not since your father was the house arms-master",
Not since,
You must have your wits about you and perhaps now is not the time to dwell on painful memories?,
Not since your father's exile,
You were no more than 12 when you were driven from the household,
Hard were the years that followed; the mercenary life is bloody and unforgiving,
"Those years stole your childhood, and eventually they took your father too",
"But your father had always insisted, to his dying breath, that his failure had been his own - that he had gotten the fate he deserved",
The memories are painful nonetheless,
The villa of Lord Cato Berryn,
Fat insects buzz lazily about in the warm and peaceful evening,
"Still, there is a chill that creeps into your very core; as if somewhere, you are fighting for your life in the dark depths",
#IntroVIllaKitchen,
You enter the kitchen and a pair of scullions offer a hurried bow,
"It's all so much quieter, emptier, and gloomier than you remember",
"Of course, Old Magda is no longer where she used to be - sitting by the oven, kind, red-faced and tending a shank of lamb",
Reminisce,
"You remember the matronly woman as she sat, humming to herself, pouring fat over the roasting meat",
"Child, come here, will you?",
Magda was always a beacon of kindness in a childhood where such qualities were few and far between,
Go to Magda,
Magda clasps you gently with her tubby hand,
Have you eaten yet?,
"Before you can answer, she produces a small bundle of treats from her apron and hands it to you",
"As son to the Master-at-Arms for the great House Berryn, you did not go wanting - materially, at least",
"As daughter to the Master-at-Arms for the great House Berryn, you did not go wanting - materially, at least",
Thank you,
Magda looks at you with kind eyes as you pick at the bundle,
He's here again,
Down in the cellar,
"He's not so good, m'child",
"Sleeping now, but it would be best if you got him to bed afore his men see him like this",
Again,
The knot in your stomach is as real now as it was when you were,
I'll go get him,
"Don't worry, he won't make a fuss",
He just needs time,
"You know, {PLAYER}, deep wounds take a long while to heal",
The old woman turns back to her meat and resumed her meandering humming,
The sound of a man clearing his throat snaps you back out of your reminiscing,
May I help you m'lord?,
May I help you m'lady?,
the man in a chef's outfit offers in a hoarse voice,
#IntroVillaLyra,
I suppose you do but I'll escort you nonetheless,
A flicker of a smile plays across her face and she beckons for you to lead the way,
Lyra,
A woman stands before the main entrance to the villa,
"Her posture speaks of a graceful, coiled power - that of a duelling ace",
No doubt she is the new master-at-arms for house Berryn,
"As you approach, she offers a quick, neat bow, just low enough to be respectful",
Greetings {PLAYER},
Master Cato welcomes you back to House Berryn,
The Master is eager to meet with you and is ready at your leisure,
"However, if you wish to refresh yourself first, he suggests you visit the kitchen for some food and then perhaps walk the grounds and gardens?",
I wish to see Cato right away!,
I shall explore a bit,
Why have I been summoned?,
The Maze?,
That is for the Master himself to answer,
And he will soon enough,
"For now though, please, get some food and look around",
I'm sure old Kydeon would be happy to see you if you've not talked to him aready,
I would rather go directly to Cato,
"If it pleases you, the Master is in his office, just ahead",
And note,
"Once you meet with the Master, things may move quickly and you may not have another chance to walk the grounds",
"Yes, I remember the way",
I'd prefer to go alone,
"On second thought, I'd rather explore a bit more first",
Excellent,
"Though I'm sure you still know your way around the grounds, the kitchen is in the building to the east, and the garden and hedge maze, is to the west",
Come back and check in with me in once you've stretched your legs,
Are you ready for Master Cato or do you wish to wander around a bit more?,
Have you eaten?,
Or perhaps see the hedge maze if the darkness does not scare you?,
It would scare me less if you joined me?,
Let's go see the Master,
There you are,
"If your nostalgia is appeased, the Master will see you now",
Let's go see Cato,
Just a moment!,
I have a few more things to do,
This estate was your home for many years; despite the circumstances you left it,
Perhaps the Master feels it would do you good to revisit some old memories?,
Lyra's eyes narrow in a barely perceptible frown,
Or some old ghosts,
What does Cato want with me?,
Perhaps it would,
Under no circumstance,
Now if you will excuse me,
#IntroVillaMaze,
You stand at the center of the maze,
"It feels much less impressive than you remember - the ornamental pond was once an ocean, the rock at its heart a wind-swept island",
"You found me, day-dreamer",
"You remember the tone of her voice, and can almost see the impish, 10-year old girl wading through the pond",
Why do you always come here?,
I like the water,
It's so calm,
Embla shoots you a mischievous look,
You notice the faintest tang of ozone,
"She makes a slow motion hop through the water, her fingers trailing the pond's surface",
"Where water and skin meet, strange colors bleed and spread across the surface",
"Embla, you'll get in trouble, stop it!",
Embla moves her fingers across the water's surface like a painter's brush,
"Colors spill across the pond and for a sleeping moment, you fancy that you can see cloud-topped mountains",
"Or was it the ramparts of an impossibly large city, reaching towards the heavens?",
"The silence is shattered by a shout, along with the beguiling images",
Mistress Embla!,
"The Master requests you in the house, immediately!",
That's my father,
Something's wrong,
It's mother,
She's 'ill' again,
I think I cause it - with what I can do,
It poisons her mind,
How long until mother isn't...mother?,
"Or until father isn't lord, or your father isn't Master-at-Arms?",
How long will any of it last?,
Why're you talking like this?,
I don't know,
No one does,
Everything falls apart in the end,
Do you ever feel like everything is a lie?,
"Like there's a veil that covers everything, but in some parts it's thin enough to see through?",
Embla starts as your father steps breathily into the enclosed garden,
He's red-faced from exertion and anger,
"Young lady, you can't run off like this, the whole estate is looking for you!",
Your mother is ill and needs you,
Your father shoots you a stern glance,
I'll deal with you later,
"Embla says nothing as your father grabs her by the arm and hauls her past you, back to the house",
She doesn't meet your eyes as you pass,
"Finding yourself back in the present, a chill has crept into your bones",
You best move on,
You stand before the gate to the hedge maze,
It stirs old feelings of both dread and elation,
"The sounds and smells of the estate grounds - as they were long ago - call to you from distant memory, You feel you could easily plunge into their depths",
"Let yourself go, and remember",
Which day-dream is it this time?,
Are you valiantly defending me from rebels again?,
"Embla throws a pine cone at you, snapping you from your reverie",
"She's 10 years old, and you're a year her senior",
"Let's play hide and go seek in the maze, I'll hide!",
You faintly hear someone yell her name from the distance,
You better run Star-child!,
Only my mother ever calls me that,
"Embla says, frowning",
Where did you hear it from?,
"Before you can reply, she flings another pine-cone at you and darts off into the maze",
Give chase,
You hear a man's voice yell Embla's name again - much closer now,
"Either way, she's lost to you in the winding passages of the hedge maze",
"Your memory tugs at you, urging you on to the center of the maze",
#IntroVillaStealth,
Lyra closes the doors to the dining hall,
Let's not keep master Cato waiting,
The finality in her voice leaves no room for discussion,
Lyra clears her throat behind you,
Not that way,
"If you don't mind, the master's office lies through here",
She motions to the left,
Do you mind if I look around a bit?,
Master Cato has summoned you and I don't intend to keep him waiting,
"Besides, there is no need for you to disturb the servants in their tasks",
I'll be silent as the night!,
Lyra goes still for a fraction of a second as if sensing something beyond just your perception,
Then her eyes narrow and a mischievous smile plays across her features,
Through the dining hall lies the hearth,
A beast lurks there,
I wager you cannot make your way past the servants in the dining hall and sneak up on this beast without being noticed?,
What shall we wager?,
On second thought,
We'll decide that once we see if you can be as quiet as you claim,
The dining hall and hearth lies ahead,
And mind your steps,
I'll only give you one chance!,
"And the glory shall be yours, sneak-thief!",
She feigns a silent applause and leads you on your way,
Lyra spins around and for a moment you fear she's going to punch you,
Abruptly she leans in and whispers in your ear,
"In that case, we shall save it for when you return from your assignment",
Now let's go,
Lyra continues to walk in silence,
"You're unsure if she heard you, but then again you get a strong feeling it's better to let the issue lay",
Continue with your tail between your legs,
Very well!,
Lyra places a coin in her open palm,
Attempt to grab it,
"Despite several attempts, you fail to snatch the coin from her",
You fail because you are waiting for the right moment to strike,
"Instead, you must strike in the void between moments",
Ponder this,
"Now, let’s go",
Lyra laughs and pats Roland on the shoulder,
"{PLAYER}, I present Roland Grayeye",
A man you should pray to always fight alongside and never against,
"Roland offers up a large, battle-worn hand and his grasp is surprisingly soft as you clasp it",
You realize he’s making an effort not to harm you with the gesture,
Good to see I’m not alone in waiting on the rich and noble,
His mouth contorts into something resembling a smile,
Have you been summoned as well?,
"You whirl around to the left, grasping instinctively at the weapon that isn't hanging by your side",
Blood rushes to your head and your mouth goes dry,
You see nothing,
In the corner of your eye you register Lyra rolling her eyes,
A slow rumbling laugh sounds from the opposite corner as a hulking shadow emerges,
Don’t feel bad,
"All it would have bought you, was time to see the killing blade",
"You whirl around to the right, grasping instinctively at the weapon that isn't hanging by your side",
The figure standing in the shadows behind you is laden with the promise of violence,
In the corner of your eye you register Lyra biting her lip in gleeful anticipation,
The figure's slow laugh has the texture of an avalanche as he slowly emerges from the shadows,
You’d be dead either way,
But at least you’d get a chance to see the blade,
The servant offers a startled shriek as she spots you,
The plate she drops echoes through the vaulted dining hall,
"Lyra emerges from the shadows behind you, apparently amused by your clumsiness",
With feigned sadness she pats your cheek,
I had expected more from you,
She leads you from the dining hall back to the foyer,
The room around you lies silent and seemingly empty save the crackling of burning logs,
The fire casts a dim light and dancing shadows,
A single goblet stands half empty on a small table,
Lyra’s warm breath on your ear startles you as she whispers near imperceptibly,
We have walked into a trap,
The beast has laid an ambush for us,
Can you sense him preparing to strike?,
Hairs stand up on your neck,
"If it is from latent danger or something else, you cannot tell",
No!,
Do not look!,
"She whispers, louder now",
Close your eyes,
Let your sensing be the absence of action,
Become empty for the ambience to flow into you,
"Now, is he to our right or left side?",
Empty your mind,
Lyra leads you back through the dining hall,
A slight sense of urgency has crept into her step,
Follow,
Wait!,
What about the wager?,
"Roland's good eye, shifts momentarily to Lyra who interjects",
One of my master's foremost skills is his ability to recognize and attract resourceful individuals,
Roland is one such individual,
"As are you, it seems",
"Now, my master has waited long enough, and you two will have enough time to get to know one another later",
Lyra offers a short bow to Roland who returns it in a surprisingly respectful manner,
We must go,
Ah; The wager!,
What is a fitting prize for such a feat?,
The glory alone will suffice,
Teach me something!,
A kiss?,
#IntroVillaVeteran,
"Tell me boy, what would yer father say if he knew you considered yourself the better of his old friends?",
"Though his voice is full of gravel, there's now a glint in his eyes, as though the old coals have begun to warm up",
"Tell me girl, what would yer father say if he knew you considered yourself the better of his old friends?",
Kydeon!?,
Is that you?,
I have no time for the ghosts of my father's past,
"Say nothing, and keep walking",
"Disappointment clouds the man's face, and he calls after you",
"Very well, I suppose you're no longer the lad I remember",
Lyra awaits at the main entrance,
"She'll take you to the Master, for better or worse",
Kydeon smiles sadly,
An old soldier's greeting,
Something one mercenary would say to another as a prayer to not dwell on painful memories,
The kind that comes with the work,
Your father and I,
Kydeon halts momentarily and looks at you,
Your father and I would always part with those words,
"Now, I've held you long enough",
"If it’s the hedge maze you mean, just head west and then north",
Then again you must have known that?,
Had to drag you out o’ there enough times,
I won't betray my Master's confidence by saying more,
Best you see him yourself,
The man offers a smile but it fails to iron out the concerned creases around his eyes,
I'll go look for the Master-at-Arms,
Never could pull the wool over your eyes,
"Truth is, many a day's been dark of late for House Berryn",
Perhaps it all started when you and your father left,
A guilty grimace flashes across his face,
Or maybe it started even earlier,
Kydeon pauses to blow out a long breath,
I'll go to the Master-at-Arms,
A single bark of laughter emanates from the dense beard as he embraces you in a crushing bear-hug,
"Kydeon may be older and grayer but from the force of his hug, you don't reckon you'd have any more chance of beating him now than you did as a 12 year old",
"Go easy, you old boar",
It's good to see some things haven't changed,
"Kydeon steps back and allows you to breathe again, before grabbing you by the shoulders",
We heard of your father's passing,
"Truly, he sits with the Golden Dead now",
"Tell me, how did he die?",
In glorious battle - at my side,
Drunk and reeking of his own piss,
Let's not dwell on old wounds,
Do you know why I'm here?,
Kydeon's eyes narrow,
Then the old warrior died a fitting death,
Kydeon is quiet for a moment then breaks into a grin,
"We'll raise a cup to his name, together, you and I!",
"Soon as you're done with Cato, and I can rustle up some ale fit for a guest",
"Kydeon, why am I here?",
It's been that long has it?,
"Well, kitchen's still in that building over on the east end of the property",
Just follow yer nose,
And the wine cellar's underneath it,
The old man fails to suppress the impulse to lick his lips,
"If you want to explore, for old time's sake, take this lantern",
Lord Berryn will wait - and we don't want you getting lost in the hedge-maze again!,
"The man laughs heartily and hands you a small, brass lantern",
"Whatever may come to pass, it did this old warrior a barrel of good to see you again boy!",
"The old man slaps you on the shoulder in parting, almost knocking you off balance",
He then seems to remember something as he leans in conspiratorially,
"Whatever may come to pass, it did this old warrior a barrel of good to see you again girl!",
Kydeon,
"An aging, armoured man in the livery of House Berryn stands and scowls at you",
"Eyes like coal peer out from a craggy face fringed top and bottom with wild, white hair",
Return his challenging stare,
Walk on by,
"The man's eyelids droop, near fully closed",
It was a cruel fate that befell your father,
"And yours, crueller still",
"For what it's worth, I'll bear memory of him as the good, honest man he was, before",
Kydeon is quiet for a moment then offers a sad smile,
Soon as you're done with the Master!,
But first,
Don't keep Lyra waiting any longer!,
Talk to her first and I'll be here for later,
Have you seen Lyra yet?,
Best not keep her waiting!,
I have your medicine,
Where was the kitchen again?,
Where do I find the garden?,
Where did you say Lyra was?,
May your sleep be dreamless?,
"The older man crosses his massive arms, steps forward and leans towards you",
"So, young sellsword, come looking for a scrap have you?",
"Kydeon, you old fool!",
Stand aside old man,
I have business with your lord,
Have you not gone to see her yet?,
You best hurry then!,
She's on the stairs right behind me there!,
"Master Cato will chew your ear plenty when you see him, {PLAYER}",
"Lyra, the new Master-at-Arms awaits you by the main entrance",
She'll escort you - and don't ask her not to,
If you think I had a temper,
The joke fails to hide the note of anxiety in the grizzled House guard's voice,
I shall look for this Lyra,
"What are you hiding from me, old boar?",
#IntroWineCellar,
"Your father jolts upright, the bloodshot whites of his eyes glaring out of the darkness",
We found her!,
Wandering the forests outside the estate!,
Mistress Valeria,
Help him stand,
"Haltingly, and leaning heavily on you, your father manages to stand",
She was never the same,
Whatever happened broke her,
"It was the girl, you know?",
The seed was planted in Valeria that night,
But how could you know?,
You were but a babe yourself,
You help lead the now sobbing man out of the cellar,
"Stop it, father!",
Lord Cato trusted me!,
And I failed him - but Valeria was the one to pay the price: mind broken and that spawn of a child,
Your father's voice seethes with fury,
Enough!,
"Don't talk back to me, you bastard!",
What do you know about honor!?,
As much as your harlot mother!,
"Your father steps away from you, unsteadily, tears streaming down his contorted face",
"Shut up, shut up, shut up!",
Turn and run,
Strike the man,
"You draw a ragged breath and snap out of the memory, your knuckles white",
You're alone in the damp cellar and don't particularly feel like dwelling there,
You're gripped by a long-hidden memory upon entering this part of the cellar,
"You sealed it away - but in so doing, preserved its strength",
"And now, it demands freedom",
You can still recall smelling him before you could make out his writhing shape in the dim light of the cellar,
Mistress Valeria!,
Open the door!,
Your father doesn't even notice you in the throes of his intoxicated ramblings,
How could they take her?,
Her chambers were locked from inside!,
Where is she!?,
Try to shake some sense into him,

# Chapter_1,

#Chapter1Governor_2,
The man - surely the Governor from his ostentatious ring of office and the guards flanking him - bars your way,
You’re not guests of mine,
Or in my employ,
What’s going on here IdraMistress?,
What’s going on here ?,
We were just leaving,
I'm just leaving,
I might ask you the same question,
PAY FOR HORRYN,
"Ah yes, the idiocy of the righteous",
What makes you think I had anything to do with whatever befell that parochial stain on my career?,
You forsook the survivors,
I can't let that stand,
It's more what you've not done to help the survivors,
An exit,
NO MISTRESS CONTINUE,
So soon?,
But we've barely got to know each other,
Pray tell - what brought you here?,
"We're mercenaries, en route to the Black Priory",
"Sheer chance, while looking for a safe haven",
I'm here to make you pay for Horryn,
You can't get much safer than here,
Who knows when contact with the mainland will be restablished,
Until then - the more the merrier,
SURVIVORS,
"Yes, well",
"Regrettably, my guests here - including many important people - are used to certain comforts",
Wine and sweet meats are hardly fit to nourish a deranged refugee,
They're better off at the camp,
You callous bastard,
Wait until your masters hear about this,
PRIORY?,
A strange destination,
Stranger still that,
Needs must,
BLACKMAIL,
You think I care about those distant bureacrats?,
Or that they care about me?,
"They sent me here because they don't care about me, ergo they care even less about Horryn",
And the Priory is a law unto itself,
"From what I can see in your ledger, they'll care",
PAY OFF,
"You petty, larcenous little",
Look,
Why sour such an occasion )#ELSEYou look as if you can handle yourself,
Why spill blood at such an occasion,
"let me make it worth your while to forget all this ugliness and join us here, as a guest of honour?",
Can you be more specific?,
Keep your pathetic bribes,
Your boat would make it worth my while,
BRIBE INFO,
Whatever for?,
There are plenty of entertainments yet to come,
And I would know who my sweetheart’s new friends are - it’s rude to arrive uninvited - far ruder to leave unannounced,
We’re mercenaries,
But we’re not here for you,
I do so hate to disappoint my guests,
Even if they are uninvited ones,
"I'll indulge you - what question, exactly, do you mean?",
What is going on here?,
I take it back,
I don't have time for this,
HERE FOR HER,
But it seems you’re here for (IdraMistress)?,
And she is a treasured part of my own soul,
"So you see - you take her, and it’s the same thing",
She steps UP,
IdraMisrtess) steps forward,
"Whatever your puerile desires, I am not owned, attached, or in any way a part of you",
I’m free to leave - and I can’t wait to be on a different continent to you,
SICK FANTASIES,
So cold IdraMistress?,
"And yet, behind closed doors, your touch, your lips, your… was warm, hot with your love for me",
I don’t want to hear about your sick fantasies,
SPIRALLING,
You’re seriously trying to take her from me?,
To where?,
This island is doomed - outside of these walls is only madness and desolation!,
"The Empire aren’t coming, if they even know",
"Stay here, and join my garrison - I can make it worth your while",
"And so an NAME, I’m sure",
Let it never be said I’m not generous with my assets,
You've gone wrong,
Eheh,
"On the contrary, I’ve never felt better - the ingrate yokels of Horryn and the meddling heretics of the Priory demanded too much of me",
"Now, at last, I am free",
"Come, (IdraMistress) - I have more delights for us planned",
I have something planned of my own,
BETRAYAL,
The guards draw their weapons,
Make short work of the Governor,
One of them speaks,
He was murdered by someone at the ball - driven crazy by grief after Horryn,
Right?,
Correct,
Good luck,
DONE,
You part ways,
The boat lies within reach,
Guards - methinks our new guests are party poopers,
And we all know what happens to those,
You'd be surprised,
#Chapter1Governor_Intro,
"You're greeted by an opulent and vast reception hall, bursting with music, extravantly dressed guests and tantalising aromas",
"The man addressing you is covered in stately marks of office, but his finery, like his smile, look ill suited to him",
"The man casts a glance around the lavish occasion, then bows",
"The Governor and Imperial Steward of Idra, Varain Kalthuun, welcomes you to the last bastion of civilisation - who might you be?'",
Mercenary,
your worst niughtmare,
something else,
"Yes, well, more the merrier I say",
This is the place to be,
I'd offer you a tour but discovering it for yourself is half the fun,
Anything I can help you with before you make merry?,
I can think of one or two things,
I'll go explore,
GO ORF,
Quite so,
"I'm sure I will bump into you shortly - until then, I only ask you stay out of any room with a closed door",
If you need anything... hah!,
You won't,
I'm sure we'll see one another again soon,
Of course,
Truly frightful business,
I always said that dingy Priory would wreak havoc somehow,
"Not much to be done now, of course, other than leave whatever is happening well alone",
It'll blow over,
Qs again,
Can you elaborate?,
Horryn MORE,
"Yes sure here are some thoughts: some kind of natural disaster, precipitated by their own folly - idk",
It could all be tainted,
QUARANTINING,
What will the mainland say about it?,
Backto Qs,
Coward!!,
OCCASION,
justification for just keeping the status quo,
Saviour xomplex,
"Once this strangeness blows over, this will be the elite men and women who rebuild into true greatness",
Back to Qs,
"Who's here, anyone famous?",
WHO'S WHO,
"well we got bob, jimmy, the count, the duck, jessie and nefarious the magister",
Return to qs,
Help coming?,
Nah,
They don't care,
Monsters in seas even if they could get here,
"They know I can handle things, and I will",
Qs,
How can I help?,
Have you heard about Horryn?,
What's the occasion?,
Is help coming?,
I'm done here,
#Chapter1Governor,
#Chapter1IagoIntro,
"You lured me here, just to rob me, like a petty criminal?",
"Oh, you poor fool - if only you knew who you were dealing with",
The Queen has many friends in the Freymark,
Freinds who prefer their dealings be kept from Imperial eyes,
"So when she bids me unfurl the black sails, I do",
With pleasure I must add,
Iago smiles broadly,
Who are these 'friends'?,
Iago puts his fingertips to his chin in mock umbrage,
You imply I exaggerate my exploits?,
"No doubt I owe you my life, but I will not suffer my honor being questioned!",
I meant no offense,
Your honour is intact,
My patience is not,
Iago barks a wry laugh,
I consider myself above the petty politics of the Imperials and Freythen,
But - I am loyal to my 'Queen' - who currently sympathises with the Thanes of Freymark,
"But if we must discuss politics, let us do so again somewhere warmer, with wine in our bellies",
"Seeming to suddenly remember, Iago asks,",
"Things are not right here on Idra, are they?",
What foulness has transpired here?,
Horryn is lost,
"To what, no-one yet knows",
Horryn's gone dark,
Iago looks askance at you,
"Well, that won't do, will it?",
"In any case, we should make haste to the queen's lair",
Not many places are safer than wherever she is,
"Before we go, I must ask",
Let's go,
Iago,
"Blessed stranger, I owe you my life!",
"When we could not spot the signal as expected, I feared we were trapped!",
"But you are not my usual contact - tell me, to whom do I owe this debt of gratitude?",
"Though the gratitude appears genuine, there is a distinct tone of caution in his voice",
We are allies of the 'Queen',
I'm a professional,
That's all,
You thank me too soon,
Give up your arms!,
Yes I guessed as much!,
"Non the less, I owe you my life",
"Had it not been for you we would have been trapped and, I fear, lost to that foul abomination from the deep!",
How so?,
"Nevertheless, I owe you my life",
A foul leviathan of the depths came upon us as soon as we spotted Idra!,
But my ship is fast and the wind was at my back,
"Had it not been, we would be ffeding the fish now",
Go on,
Spare me the drama!,
"Bless the stars, we made it to the realtive safetfy of the outer searocks",
"The leviathan it seems, will not give chase into shallow waters",
"However, we had gone from the frying pan, into the fire!",
Go on!,
Oh spare me the drama!,
Imperials prowl the shores and costs of Idra due to the nature of the cargo we carry and the friends we keep,
We did not dare approach land until the signal was given!,
I don't have time for this drama!,
You've fallen into my trap!,
Now give up your arms!,
"You may sail with me, if you wish it?",
"We'll stay close to the coast, it should be perfectly safe",
Thank you - I accept,
We'll meet you there,
"I know it was angry, possessed of many tentacles, and had a deep hunger for handsome, daring sailors",
"Beyond that, the thing is a bloody terrifying mystery to me",
That about lines up with my experience,
"I doubt it's that discerning, but yes",
Iago grins rakishly,
We need your ship!,
What do you know of the leviathan?,
What cargo do you carry?,
It's time we got going,
I understand your desire - she's quite the beauty,
"Sleek, trusty - happy so long as she has a few strong hands on her",
But I guess you had something more specific in mind?,
I need to sail into the Black Priory,
"To get off this rock, for good",
Try asking me again - and a little more politely - after we've visited my lady the Queen,
And when you can reassure me that the many-legged sea-bastard won't smash us into smithereens,
I will,
I'll ask however I please,
#Chapter1MinorEncounters,
Dead Sailors,
Corpses litter the ground,
"Tragically, these sailors appear to have made it to shore only to be brutally murdered",
The horrid wounds and grusome dismemberments tells you that this must have been the work of mad men,
The work of those bloody reavers no doubt,
Rolands growls,
Rats,
"As you enter the darkened lighthouse, you spot a pair of hideously transformed creatures that must once have been rats!",
They scurry off into the darkness leaving you with a pounding heart,
You must be carefull as you advance,
#Chapter1Mistress,
"There are many beautiful women, elegantly and richly dressed and coiffed, mincing around the room - but one stands clearly apart",
"Not because she’s somehow on another plane of beatific loveliness - quite the opposite - she’s dressed as plainly as could be considered ‘polite’, her hair is piled high - but more like a stack of bird nests than the latest court fashion",
It also appears she’s applied her makeup with the intention of looking as fierce as possible,
Don’t tell me” she sighs,
You forgot your ball gowns,
We’re not here for the party,
Are you the governor’s mistress?,
LEDGERS,
"Well, I know where keeps his ledgers",
They’re either heavily forged or going to clearly show where the Imperial coin has been going,
Would that help?,
PAYMENT,
"Yes, yes",
I can easily help you liberate some of his more valuable office of state accoutrement,
"Or, to put it in language someone such as you might understand - I can help you rob him blind",
about her,
"Elemai, is my name",
"And I prefer the term ‘consort’, but you have the truth of it",
Well - to whom do I owe the pleasure?,
I'm a mercenary,
why here,
"And you gate-crashed our little soiree - to what, drum up business?",
Kill the governor?,
Sabotage the canapes?,
I need to commandeer a boat,
Maybe you can help,
I'm just investigating,
I'm here to kill the Governor,
I'm here to get you out,
why boat?,
"Oh, I’m scandalised",
To get into the Black Priory,
priory,
"That place is both locked up tight, and yet also the source of all this...unpleasantness...if I understand correctly",
We're on a rescue mission,
It's a private matter,
Someone needs to pay,
rescuie her,
What would you say to rescuing me into the bargain?,
I can make it worth your while,
"If you don't get in our way, sure",
I'm going to need to ask you something first,
Absolutely not,
It won't be safe,
ABOUT GOVERNOR,
"You mean, aside from the fact he’s a colossal coward, an inveterate dandy and a hopelessly profligate spender?",
At least he lets me walk all over him,
"I mean, literally - that’s his favourite - the damn pervert",
That's enough about him,
"Yes, aside from that",
HAPPY?,
Happy?,
HAPPY?!,
"She laughs wildly, throwing her head back, before grabbing another fluted glass of wine from a passing servant",
"I live in a prison of endless, half-hearted debauchery",
What more could a girl want?,
So come with us,
Did the Governor kidnap you?,
"Much as I’ve come to loathe him, no - I came here of my own volition",
Plan was to elevate my social standing then leave him for dust,
But the light went out on that plan just as they did in Horryn,
Understood,
I would ask another question,
THE PLAN,
"You mean to carve a path through our guards, crew the ship and somehow guarantee I’ll make it back to the mainland in one piece?",
Precisely,
DETAILS,
Then I’m in!,
But - should we discuss details?,
The Governor is still an Imperial agent after all - what's to say we won't be thrown in jail soon as set foot on the mainland?,
We're going to need insurance,
You said you could make it worth my while?,
It's not going to be an issue,
QUESTIONS,
You can but ask,
You're not happy here?,
What can you tell me about the Governor?,
#Chapter1Monolith,
Your eyes are drawn in by the mesmerizing spiral symbol,
For a brief moment it almost seems to shift,
Driina brushes her hand across it,
I've seen these spirals before,
The fishermen of Idra paint them on the prows of their boats for luck,
Foolish superstitions,
You avert your eyes and instead shift the small pile of offerings with your foot,
It occurs to you that these can't be more than a few weeks old,
Or perhaps days?,
A Standing Stone,
A grim monolith rises from the rugged landscape,
"Ancient and weathered, the stone must have stood here for centuries",
"Painted on it are crude spiral-shaped runes and at the base of the monolith lie piles of eggshells, flowers and fishbones",
Examine closer,
#Chapter1Palace_Guards,
"A large, stately villa set amidst sprawling gardens is ringed by a large, iron fence",
"Even from this distance, you can hear the faint noise of merrymaking - and judging from the state of the gardens, this party has been going on for quite some time",
You approach the main gate,
There are two lightly armed guards - looking better suited to a pageant than a battle - looking dejected and tired,
One of them half-heartedly tilts his halberd - colourfully adorned with various tassels - at you as you near,
Halt,
Do you have an invitation?,
Invitation?,
To what?,
You don't need to see my invitation,
I have business with the Governor,
Attack them,
FLEE,
should we really flee?,
Yah,
There's a refugee camp - they could really do with the help,
Do it,
I'm about to raise hell in here,
"Your call, lads",
LEMME IN,
The two guards exchange glances,
The guard that has so far remained silent looks pleadingly at the other,
"Music continues to waft from the villa, while stately silhouettes glide past them the wall windows",
"I'm coming in, either way",
I've got a better idea,
IN,
It's not worth our trouble anyway,
Thanks,
Wise choice,
Gov Qs,
Mistress?,
Garrison?,
"The guard addressing you sighs, while his counterpart looks disinterestedly into the distance",
"Look, whatever has happened in Horryn, there’s still order here",
"And you’ll need at least some kind of reason for us to let you - an armed, and complete stranger - into the villa",
You don’t seem very...dutiful,
I have urgent business with the Governor,
Good luck with that,
The Governor is not exactly studiously poring over paperwork these days,
"What is this 'business', anyway?",
I bear word from his Chamberlain,
It's between me and him,
Let me through,
I really don't have time for this,
"Times are strange, but we’re still soldiers of the Empire, with orders to keep anyone from disrupting the ball",
And to wear these damn parade colours,
"Tell us who you are, and perhaps we'll consider it",
Mercenaries,
"And I would see the governor, invitation or no",
We're working for the Chamberlain,
"None of your business, peasant",
Barris?!,
He's alive?,
"After Horryn, we promised we'd help him",
He is,
He's administrating the refugee camp,
BARGING IN,
The second guard stands a little more to attention,
"The first one give you an appraising glance, making no disguise of his interest in your weapons",
I don’t want any trouble,
But you’ll make it for us if you barge in,
It won't be worse than Horryn,
So move,
This is not normal,
Can't you see that?,
You’ve been to Horryn?!,
Yeah and it's not pretty,
Have you news?,
We’ve been desperate to go...to help,
But the Governor forbade it - said something about 'protecting the last bastion of Imperial rule on Idra',
What’s happening there?,
Not sure,
Why didn't you go?,
The GOvernor wouldn’t let us,
He said it’s more important to maintain order of the ‘administrative hub’ than some ‘backwater village full of luddites.’,
You really believe that?,
RULES,
I mean...the Imperium still stands,
We can’t just...the rules!,
The old rules don't apply,
Do you really trust the Governor still?,
I need to know more about the situation here,
SUGGESTIONS,
I know what you’re getting at,
Don’t think we haven’t joked about it,
But it's hard to know if any of us would actually go through with it,
You could leave,
"There’s no law left on this island, trust me",
He'll bring ruin on you all,
Unless you act now,
Let me in,
I'll take care of everything,
ABOUT THE CAMP,
Refugees?,
From...Horryn?,
Yeah,
Horryn is gone,
He's...become extravagant,
More so than usual,
He's not left the Villa in days,
"He was always..eccentric, but I'm not afraid to tell you - the lads and I, we're not happy with how he's handling... whatever is going on",
So take matters into your own hands,
More about the gov,
Listen to me - what you're talking about is treason,
"Or at least...it would be, if his mistress wasn't on board to vouch for us",
She's an innocent in this - I won't let her blood be on our hands,
I'll get her on side,
How will I signal you?,
KILL,
She wears a ring,
Have her send it to us via a servant if she wishes to be a part of this,
I'll be going in then,
What is it?,
Tell me more about the Governor,
What do you know about the mistress?,
What's the mood among the garrison?,
#Chapter1RatQueenDEFFUNCT,
"The lady in front of you holds herself with a disciplined ease, her chin tilted proudly up",
This is clearly her kingdom - though you'd guess she'd look as confident anywhere else,
Now she is lounging on a “throne” made out of crates and covered in a black sail as they are hiding in a cave,
You've seen the alternative,
"I hardly meant to make this festering sewer system my palace, but needs must",
I have more questions,
I'm in,
A little kingdom called ___,
"Or at least, it used to be - until the Empire swallowed it whole",
"Now I'm an itinerant Queen, ruling over a few ships and fair but apparently illegal trade",
I have further questions,
I'll help you,
Not overly fond,
"The Freythen rebels pay good coin, but more importantly they do good work",
"I feel very good about my business, but I'd feel even better doing it in broad daylight, free from the Imperial yoke",
I would ask something else,
Count me in,
What's next?,
"I visited once, a while ago",
It's a strange place,
I always wondered why a place of learning - as they claim - was so well fortified,
If you're going in - just consider what they might be trying to keep from escaping,
May I ask,
Let's work together,
Naturally,
Find the Harbourmaster's office,
Get the codebook,
"Bring it to me, and together we'll signal the ship and leave this sorry sewer",
"Well then, what have we here?",
Come to seek an audience with the Rat Queen?,
"Speak fast, and true",
I stumbled upon this place,
I've never heard of you,
The Rat Queen!?,
What kind of name is that?,
Just so?,
How curious: you're clearly not from Idra; you've not made the mistake of attacking us; you claim not to know me,
"I would guess you're a mercenary, seeking answers or fortune now that Horryn lies under shadow",
Well deduced,
Wrong,
We intend to break into the Black Priory,
Partly,
Our real goal is to infiltrate the Black Priory,
As it should be,
"Although - if you did not seek me out, how came you here?",
I'm investigating the fall of Horryn,
Exploring,
I found you by chance,
It's my proper title,
"And if you want to stay in the good graces of myself - and my subjects here - I suggest you use, and respect it",
I meant no disrespect,
My respect is earned,
"You're ambitious, I like that",
"And maybe stupid, unless you have a boat",
"Well, we did have",
Perhaps you could help us with that,
And if we don't?,
"But that's not your ultimate goal, is it now?",
Sharp,
We need to break into the Black Priory,
No,
We're here to rescue someone from the Priory,
"The Queen leans forward, some intent you can't place glittering in her eyes",
That's a charming term for 'looting',
You needn't play coy with me,
As long as that's all it is?,
"Ultimately, we're on a rescue mission to the Black Priory",
We're here to retrieve a girl from the Black Priory,
Ah,
"It seems in this loss, we are alike",
What's your plan?,
Any ideas how we could get a new one?,
"Then, by all means, try and walk through the front door",
Just let me know so that I can make sure to watch,
Maybe a boat makes sense,
Can we charter yours?,
"You see, this is what I was wondering",
My ships were smashed by the Leviathan - or whatever that abomination of the sea is called,
"Thankully, it does not seem to venture too close to shore",
There is a way we can get one though - and it's imperative that we do so quickly,
"We have some cargo here that the Imperial Rescue Mission - slow, but inevitable - would be all too happy to confiscate, along with my liberty",
I can get a boat,
"There is one off-shore, awaiting the coded signals that I don't have, because they're stuck in a Harbourmaster's Office that's overrun by twisted creatures",
"If the Imperials find the signal book, it's over for me - and no ship for you",
"Help me get it back, and I promise we'll ferry you into the Priory before we escape with the cargo",
"Might even come back to pick you up, if you survive",
I have to ask,
Say no more,
I applaud your enthusiasm - but I'm not so sure about your blind trust,
"Fine, I'll ask some questions",
"You want this doing, or not?",
Go on?,
Why are you living down here?,
Where did you come from?,
How do you feel about the Empire?,
What do you know about the Priory?,
#Chapter1Roland,
Howling laughter fills the air as the mad-men charge towards you!,
The man licks his sore lips excitedly,
You… you hear it too?,
The call?,
I do!,
"Where... or what, is it coming from?",
"Straining to see through the dense fog, you finally spot them",
A group of men prowling the shoreline like carrion-eaters looking for dead flesh,
They are unkempt and dressed in rags with bare torsos and broad shoulders adorned by a strange mixture of sailor's tattoos and crude symbols,
"They carry an assortment of cruel-looking, rusted tools turned to weapons",
"Gibbering chatter, laughter and whimpering drifts across the fog in a steady stream, Whoever these men are, their minds are long gone",
You sit still until a group of them passes you by,
Perhaps you might be able to slip past them?,
Call out to the men,
Leave quietly,
The spiral patterns look oddly familiar though you are certain you’ve never seen it before,
It’s something deeper,
Something primal,
It draws you in!,
Here - to this place,
This is the beginning and the end,
The Reavers notice you staring,
You hear it don’t you?,
The call of... what?,
The men fan out and regard you with a cruel glare,
I’m going to enjoy this,
one of them snarls as he draws a rusty dagger,
I'm going to put you down like a rabid dog!,
Let's be civil about this!,
"You see a figure, thrashing violently at something, obscured by the low fog",
"Whatever this person is doing, it's producing loud crunching, wet squelches, and a stream of curses",
Move closer,
You see the scene for what it is,
"Roland, soaked through and spattered with ichor, is laying waste to a number of grotesque looking creatures with a piece of driftwood",
He snarls like a wounded beast and his eyes are black with rage,
"As the last of the horrid beasts falls twitching back into the shallows, Roland snaps his gaze to you - dead eyes staring at some distant point on the horizon behind you",
"Eventually, the tension drains from his muscles, and he lowers his makeshift weapon",
Thought I was carrion they did,
I nearly was,
I didn't think you'd make it,
"Seems I've got a few lives left in me, for all they're worth",
Roland sighs deeply and slumps down onto a nearby rock,
You tried to save me,
You bloody idiot,
Not exactly the thanks I was expecting,
The mission needs you,
Was half hoping I wouldn't,
"He looks around at the driftwood and chunks of flesh, bobbing around your ankles",
It's about time I payed my debts,
You wanted to die?,
I'm counting on you to get this job done,
I think it's best we part ways,
There's no room for being a bloody hero in work like this,
"It's just shit, blood, and bad men doing worse things to others",
It's about time I paid my debts,
"And yet, here we are",
You sound like you didn't want to be saved,
Spoken like a true mercenary!,
There might be hope for one of us after all,
"Well, now there's work to be done",
What do you mean?,
As you say,
But heed this: if you want to survive you need to drop the bloody heroics,
This business makes your hands dirty - and nothing gets them clean again,
Trust me on that,
"Speaking of which, I suppose I still work for you",
We should get going,
I'm counting on you,
Let's get going,
Roland looks out across the uncaring sea,
Not many get to be my age in our line of work,
The things that I've seen - that I've done,
Memories like that prey upon you,
"Like bloody wolves circling a camp, with the fire dying out",
"Second you let your guard down, they pounce",
"Your time isn't over yet, old man",
Why don't you retire?,
So would you rather I'd let you die?,
"I tried, once",
The quiet only made the memories louder,
"You wait, expecting Roland to elaborate",
He merely stares blanky ahead,
We need to be on our way,
No I,
Rolands words catch in his throat,
He thinks for a moment and then looks up at you with a determined look,
"When my time is up, my time is up",
Do you understand?,
Alright Roland,
"Roland nods solemnly, brushes a sticky glob of ichor off his arm, and trudges over to you",
"His lips part as if to speak, but he hesitates",
Let's just go,
The brute scowls at you for a moment,
"If that's what you want, I'm not going to stop you",
Maybe I'll rest at that Lighthouse awhile,
No hard feelings,
"On second thoughts, I'm going to need you",
Roland does not seem to hear you,
Instead he is staring intently ahead,
There are men in the fog,
I thought I heard them earlier,
I'm certain they're not from the Zephyr and I'd wager they're less than friendly,
"I don't care if you're itching for a fight or not, but either way - we should tread carefully",
"I don't care if you're itching for a fight or not, but either way - you should tread carefully",
Rolands slinks off into the thick fog,
He smiles a toothless grin,
That’s the question ain’t it?,
The men lower their weapons,
"When you’re ready, Father is waiting for you",
In Horryn,
Without another word the men turn and wander off into the fog,
Soon they are gone,
I’ll have you talking once I stick this knife in your gut!,
The largest of the group steps menacingly towards you,
If it's a fight you want,
Look closer at the men's tattoos,
I'm here to join you!,
#EvilMercs,
A group of warriors dressed in drab armor with crudely painted wolf skulls on their chests,
They are picking their way through the rocky terrain like prowling felines and you have no doubt these are killers who excel at their job,
#IdraCostalPassCombat,
Your ploy is for naught,
One of the cackling cultists points in your direction and a cry of alarm goes up!,
The beast abruptly halts its feasting and eyestalks eagerly spin around,
"As it spots you, it offers a deafening roar before charging!",
You carefully pick your way forwards when movement on the top of the cliffs catches your eyes,
Robed and hooded figures emerge as they appear to be dragging something towards the edge of the cliff,
More of the rabid dogs,
spits Roland,
No doubt the same mad-men you saw earlier,
To your horror you realize what the party is dragging,
"A naked man and woman, bound and gagged, are struggling desperately as they are mercilessly pushed towards the edge of the cliff",
"whispers Kat, almost too loud",
We have to do something!,
Terror rises in you as you understand what is about to unfold,
You need to do something!,
Look around,
One of the cultists shouts and points towards the surf in elation,
Utter terror fills the eyes of the moribund couple,
"You follow their gaze and turn to see, emerging from the surf, a creature of sheer horror",
"Larger than any sea-creature you’ve fought so far, a hulking shape greedily waddles towards the base of the cliffs",
Pincers snapping and tentacles squirming greedily,
Before you can react further the cultists hurl the two naked forms from the cliffs,
"The pair impact the ground below with a sickening splat and with surprising speed, the hulking beast falls upon their remains",
Standing transfixed you watch as the horror consumes the remains of the unfortunate wretches,
Sickening snaps and wet pops fill the air as the creature feeds,
"All the while, the robed cultists stand swaying and chanting on the ledge above",
Attack the terror,
Carefully attempt to sneak away,
Sink to your knees and join in the worship,
You don’t dare to breathe as you slowly pick your way back the way you came,
"As soon as you feel certain you’re out of sight, panic takes over and you run as fast as you can",
By the time you stop you’re utterly exhausted but at least you are still alive,
"Dropping to your knees, you close your eyes and begin mock-chanting",
"Tears press on but you find that, strangely enough, words begin to take form",
Words that make sense then and there but that you will never again be able to recall,
A spiral burns in your mind - it calls you,
A jolt passes through you and you open your eyes wide to find the horrid creature and cultists gone,
How long were you gone?,
It felt like minutes!,
Or was it hours?,
Days?,
"Nonetheless, the terror from the deep seems to have spared you",
You rise painfully on unsteady legs and leave,
#IdraCostalPassEnter,
Said many a short-lived young fool,
Let’s just be on our bloody way!,
The winding coastal road constricts as steep cliffs press in from the north,
The dense fog reduces visibility to a mere stone’s throw and you feel an uneasiness rise in your stomach,
You swallow hard as you ponder the dangers that may lay ahead,
"Then, as in response to your concern, a bizarre monstrous growl echoes through the cliffs ahead of you",
Frozen mid-step you scan the mists when the unmistaken stench of rotting flesh is wafted towards you,
Something large and deadly lies ahead,
"Though you feel well armed and prepared, the creature in the mist is no doubt dangerous",
Your road lies ahead but you must proceed with caution,
"Though you do not know what lies ahead, your gut instinct tells you that you must be cautious",
"You wonder if perhaps for now, you would be better off spending a bit more time preparing and arming yourself?",
Roland places his hand on the hilt of his weapon as he scowls into the mist,
Keep your wits about you,
I fear we may have our work cut out for us,
Whatever lies ahead I fear it is yet beyond our mettle,
What do you recommend?,
I don’t need your advice old man!,
Not so keen to die anymore?,
I say we forge ahead,
But let’s keep our wits about us,
I’m inclined to agree with the big man,
Kat adds as she looks around nervously,
I say we turn back for now,
We need more time to prepare for whatever lies ahead,
I agree,
Roland shoots you a look that is somewhere between hurt and enraged,
"Then, as he opens his mouth to say something he’s interrupted by yet another terrible howl",
Let’s just be on our way,

# Chapter_1_Forest,
#,
#Chapter1ForestDeadHorse,
As you finish up the grisly task you are rewarded with a large quantity of rotting horse-flesh,
Utterly inedible to humans but perhaps a treat for some other beastie?,
A dead horse,
The bloated corpse has begun to fester and fat flies buzz over it,
Carve flesh from the corpse,
"As you begin carving up the rotting corpse, the stench of decay is nearly overwhelming",
Clouds of flies swarm you and crawl over every unexposed part of your skin,
"No doubt to the insectile fiends great delight, you are overwhelmed by nausea and end up on your knees, vomiting profusely",
"There is however only one way forward and having purged yourself adequately, you return to the work of cutting up the poor animal",
"Nonetheless, you steel yourself and make good progress",
#Chapter1ForestRottenMeat,
You heave large chunks of the disgusting flesh into the feeding pile,
Almost immediately you hear a number of hisses from deeper inside the cave,
Dinner is apparently served,
Hide and observe,
Slavering scaled beasts lumber into the chamber with their forked tongues greedily sampling the air,
A feeding frenzy erupts as the pack tears into the rotting flesh,
Within seconds the flesh is gone and the reprehensible reptiles stagger back into the depths of the cave as the post feeding drowsiness overcomes them,
Soon hissing snores echo throughout the caves,
Perhaps the beasts will be slightly more easy to sneak past now?,
A disgusting pile of torn and rotting meat litters the floor,
"Despite the rancid smell assaulting your senses, it appears the two lizards were greedily gorging themselves on it",
Examine the pile more closely,
Examine the area,
Place the rotting horse-flesh in the pile,
"Judging by the number of tracks and quantity of broken bones, a large number of these creatures seem to use this area as a communal feeding ground",
"Beyond that, you would rather just get away from the stench",
You’ve heard that reptiles like these tend to eat large quantities when food is readily available before waddling off to sleep for days afterwards,
Perhaps this can be used to your advantage?,
The lingering stench also gives you the impression that this particular species has a preference for rotted flesh,
#Chapter1KataksChild,
A Scream,
"As you make your way through the dense underbrush a terrible, inhuman scream cuts through the forest",
You instantly recognize it as the foul abomination that fled from 'Mother' Katak's cottage,
No doubt the creature still lives,
A Shadow,
You stop dead in your tracks as you suddenly see a shadow in the corner of your eyes,
"As you turn to look, it's gone",
"Then suddenly, an unmistakable piping sounds from behind you",
You whirl around but once again the source is gone,
There is no doubt however,
Mother Katak's child is stalking you,
#Chapter1LizardCave,
The temperature is noticeably higher in this chamber,
"Strange nest-like structures cover the ground and in each of them, lies a clutch of large yellowish eggs",
#Chapter1Witch,
The old woman smiles,
"Why, my wonderful little greedy piglet!",
Can you believe I found him in the woods just a few days ago?,
Poor baby was starved,
You found him?,
In the woods?,
It's a blessing from the Emperors themselves!,
"Now I really am a mother, just like all the women I've helped",
An inhuman scream escapes the crib,
"The blanket bulges, as if something much larger than a baby is moving around",
Look in the crib,
I'm leaving,
NO!,
He's MINE!,
The old woman lunges to her feet and defiantly places herself between you and the crib,
The screams from the crib grow more frantic,
Stand aside!,
Listen to me,
That is not a child!,
She lets out a pained sound,
He's just a baby!,
"Please, I've lost so many already, I can't lose another",
I'm sorry,
Push aside the old woman,
You push aside the old woman to get to the crib,
"As you pull off the blanket you see an inhuman squirming mass of teeth, eyes and what appears to be tentacles",
The eyes stare at you without blinking,
And then the creature howls,
Abomination!,
Driina utters in shock,
Bludgeon the thing,
I'm leaving!,
The horror lunges at you with inhuman speed,
"You thrash around the cottage as it snaps at your face, until finally, you manage to smash it into the wall",
"The screams of the abomination mix with those of the old woman as it rapidly scuttles off, up the chimney and into the woods",
Ohhh look at these beautiful eggs!,
The crone strokes gently,
They will do fine,
My concoction is nearly ready!,
She cracks the large eggs open and dumps the squirming contents into her cauldron,
Steam begins to rise and the mixture changes color to a deep crimson,
Look what you've done!,
The old woman falls to her knees and burries her face in her hands,
Roland stares at the scene - mouth agape,
This is insanity!,
Take the medicine and leave,
The old woman begins to tremble as tears run down her cheeks,
"Then a broad, manic smile twists across her face",
My boy is hungry,
He says I'm not enough for him anymore,
"The old woman pulls her robes slightly down, revealing her torso",
"It is mared by half a dozen obscene, round wounds",
A hearty meal will do him good,
the woman smiles serenely as a horrid chirp escapes the crib,
The blanket in the crib ripples as something much larger than a child rises from it,
"An inhuman squirming mass of teeth, eyes and what appears to be tentacles",
This is madness!,
Mother Katak,
"An old woman sits beside a crib, her silver hair loose and tangled around her shoulders",
"She hums to herself as she rocks the crib back and forth, a smile tugging at her weathered lips",
"The cottage is dimly lit, and the room is filled with various dried plants",
"The air is heavy with the scents of lavendar, thyme, and the unmistakeable taint of rot",
Are you Mother Katak?,
Do you have anything to trade?,
The woman looks up at you with ancient gray eyes,
That I am indeed,
"What can I do for you, child?",
A strange coo escapes the crib,
It sounds off,
"You try to peer inside, but the old woman shifts, obscuring your view",
Explain about the outbreak in the camp,
"As you explain the situation, the woman absentmindedly rocks the cradle by her side",
She chuckles softly,
So the fine folk of Horryn have a bit of a belly-ache and they thought ‘who better to save us then kindly old Katak?,
It was Hannah who sent me here,
Her boy is sick as well,
The old woman decants the mixture into a glass bottle,
This will do,
Soak bread in a thimble of this and it will purge your guts of any foulness,
She hands you the bottle and before slumping heavily down in her chair,
Suddenly the previously animated woman looks exhausted,
The crib rocks slightly as a low growl escapes it,
What's in the crib?,
Little Allyn?,
"Oh, he's such a lovely little boy!",
Almost like my little piglet here,
She pats the crib,
"The strange, piping sound coming from it sounds nothing like a child",
I’ll help of course,
No need to fret,
the old woman says with a chuckle,
Getting rid of your tummy aches takes old magic,
Magic from the earth!,
What do you need?,
Find me the unborn of the scaled ones!,
They dwell not far from here: north of the great oak and past the fetid pools!,
But beware!,
The scaled ones are fierce and guard their un-born well!,
the old woman chuckles,
Do you mean these lizard eggs?,
I suppose I'll do my best,
The old woman either can’t or won’t hear you,
She rattles on unfazed,
The old woman chuckles again,
Even the coldest of hearts pour the warmest of love into their young!,
Makes the flesh of the unborn oh so tender,
And potent you know!,
Now off you go!,
Me babe needs his sleep,
The crone is babbling incoherently while tears stream down her face,
Suddenly she seems to notice you,
You did this!!,
You took my boy from me!,
There is nothing more for you here,
The crone hums to herself as she gently rocks the crib back and forth,
I have the eggs!,
Want to trade?,
#SantaFury2,
"Come to think of it, a bit of bloodshed might be just what I need right now!",
"Come on then, you bastard",
"There are people, groups even, you just do not talk about and I’m not about to start with you",
"Since you’re moments away from death however, I’ll give you this much",
There are secrets in the Empire so deeply hidden you’ll only ever be able to perceive the faintest of their outlines,
"So monumental are they, that even though they’re in front of your very nose, you’re unable to perceive them",
The rest of Carylla’s group looks at her anxiously,
"Cary, you shouldn't",
one of them whispers to her,
Carylla’s eyes narrow,
Have no fear Pieter,
This one’s at the end of the road,
"Wait, I had some more questions first!",
Prepare to die you bitch!,
The group exchanges nervous glances,
I’m paid well to not ask questions and that’s a particularly dangerous question to ask,
"Let’s just say, someone was willing to put a lot of gold towards recovering this",
Carylla pats the bag hanging by her side,
"So, shall I gut you now?",
I had some more questions first,
Who's paying you?,
Let's dance!,
"As you approach the camp, a group of armed men and women whirl to face you",
You recognize them as the troupe who ‘relieved’ you of the Santa Fury idol,
"They do, however, look quite a bit rougher compared to when you saw them last",
"Carylla, the leader of the group draws her sword and points it at you",
You?,
"Tell me, is your death-wish truly that strong?",
All I want is to get paid for this bloody idol and leave this fucking island!,
Turns out that’s rather difficult at the moment and now I have to take time off from my drinking to spill your stinking guts as well?!,
"Wait, let's parlay!",
What are we waiting for?,
I'll indulge you,
What is that idol?,
Who hired you?,
How about I just take the idol of your hands?,
Enought talk!,
Time to die!,
Carylla lets out a sound somewhere between a snort and a laugh,
"Pray tell, why would I do that?",
"For all her bravado, there is something",
The slightest hint of doubt,
Hand it over and I'll let you live,
One of the lackeys look pleadingly at her but Carylla is adamant,
You don’t understand do you?,
There are forces at work far more powerful and much darker than you can fathom,
Your threats pale in comparison to what they would do,
The group quickly and quietly slinks off into the forest leaving you behind with the idol,
"As you remove it from the sack and gaze upon the grotesque form, a ringing rises in your ears",
This is no mere mundane item - of that you have no doubt,
"As you stow it in your pack, you can’t help but wonder if Carylla’s final words were true",
"Have you drawn the ire of other, darker forces?",
"One of the men leans in, speaking to Carylla",
"Cary, ’s onto something yeah?",
Let’s get out of here and leave that bleedin’ thing for them?,
Let them deal with it!,
Carylla swallows hard,
Then throws you a sack with something heavy in it,
Have the fucking thing!,
Maybe I’ll finally get to sleep now,
But hear me,
Men will be coming for that,
Men far more powerful than me and my lot,
So you best sleep with one eye open from now on,
"If you’re able to sleep at all, that is",
Take the idol,
#SpiderCaveSon,
Ol’ mother Katak’s cottage lies to the north-east,
Has a great big tree growing through it so you can’t miss it,
Ol’ lady’s a bit strange but she knows things!,
Potions and herbs and such,
Might even have some to sell you,
Anything else?,
Aye!,
There’s a bit of marshland north of the big oak,
I’d stay out of there,
There’s lizards and such and they say even a single bite is enough to kill ya on account of the disease they carry in their mouths!,
Thanks!,
I'll get going then,
Tombs bless you!,
"If... when you find my dar, tell him I’ll be waiting for him at home!",
"The boy sets off into the woods and once more, the forest is quiet",
"To your surprise, a young man crashes through the undergrowth ahead of you",
His face is red and he’s panting heavily as he spots you,
He... help!,
They took ‘im!,
They took who?,
My dar!,
We were working at the lumber-camp when they just burst out of the trees!,
My dar took a swing at em with ‘is axe an told me to run!,
The boy breaks down and sobs,
But I saw ‘em take ‘im and drag ‘im into the forest!,
What took your father?,
I couldn’t tell you because they kind of hid in the undergrowth!,
But they were large as hounds and all I saw was the gleam from their terrible eyes!,
Please,
You have to go look for 'im!,
He’s all I got left since ma died!,
I'll try,
Camp’s to the east of here!,
Just go past the big oak and then you’ll eventually see our lean-to and campfire!,
Please hurry!,
Anything else of note in the area?,
#SpiderCaveSurvivor,
I’ll make my own way out,
Surely my boy is waiting,
Fare thee well and be careful - These are dark times,
The man bows deeply and leaves,
You recoil in shock as the cocoon shifts under your hands!,
Whatever is inside is still alive,
"As you stand there dumbstruck, you can hear faint moaning",
Cut open the cocoon,
You carefully cut open the cocoon and a large man stumbles out,
"No doubt shaken and disoriented from the ordeal, the poor fellow looks at you with wide eyes",
What,
Who,
Where?,
Your son sent me to look for you!,
Recollection creeps back into the man’s eyes,
So,
So Lon’s alive?,
He made it!?,
Thank the Golden!,
And you,
You risked your own life to save me?,
How can I ever repay you?,
No reward is necessary,
Surely you have something?,
"In that case, you have my eternal gratitude my lord!",
"In that case, you have my eternal gratitude my lady!",
Here,
Take my axe!,
It's as well crafted as they come and I'm sure it'll fetch you a pretty penny at the market!,
Thank you!,

#Chapter1ArrivalInGlen,
You shield your face from the cold winds and icy drizzle as you survey the area,
"In the secluded valley that lies ahead, you spot the unmistakable, shaggy white forms of a flock of goats",
You’re just about to make your way towards them when a strange undulating howl echoes through the small valley,
There's more than goats in this area,
#Chapter1Shepherd,
The pale-faced youth looks at you with desperation,
What about them?,
I talked to your dad,
We're to take the goats to camp,
These goats are going to the camp,
Never mind,
I have some questions,
I have to go,
Stay here for now,
The boy lets out a pathetic yelp as he swings his staff at you!,
"Before you can step aside, Roland’s fist shatters the boy’s jaw",
"He tumbles to the ground and with a sickening crack, his skull smashes open against a large rock",
His swing goes wild and he tumbles to the ground,
"There her remains, sobbing",
You fail to get another word out of him and decide it’s best to be on your way,
Lead the animals away,
He clings to his blanket with trembling fingers,
I...I don't know,
Nothin' on Idra should be able to make a sound like that,
"Whatever it is, it ain't human",
I never see 'em,
"Every night the mist rolls in, and then shapes appear just outside the circle of my fire",
And then I...I can feel 'em!,
The boy starts to sob,
"I know they're there, but no matter how terrified I am, I can't stay awake!",
"I always fall asleep, and when I wake up the next morning",
The boy drops his head into his trembling hands,
"I never see 'em do it, but every mornin' there are fresh marks on my goats...on me",
"They're feeding on us, I know they are!",
"The goats suddenly get to their feet, bleating nervously",
Their gazes are fixed on something beyond the grey sea-mist that constantly blanks Idra,
The youth sinks to the ground and begins sobbing loudly,
You don’t get any more sense out of him and there is nothing left to do but lead the animals away,
Huddled inside a hollow mountain crevice is a young man surrounded by half a dozen goats,
"He is shivering violently beneath a worn blanket, his gaunt face pale in the dim light",
The goats look no healthier,
W-w-who goes there!?,
Keep away - I've got nothing for you!,
Who are you?,
"You're Jakub's boy, I presume?",
"The boy looks up at you with wide, too-trusting eyes",
M-my name is Aiden,
I live at a farm just outside of Horryn,
Dar trusts me to,
Why are you out here?,
It isn't safe,
I,
I'm doin' my part for the family!,
An inhuman shriek once again cuts through the mountains,
The boy freezes in terror,
What was that?,
The shepherd eyes you suspiciously,
I m-might be,
Did he,
Before he can finish an inhuman shriek once again cuts through the mountains,
"Working as fast as you can, you get the ragged flock moving and set off towards the camp",
"No, wait!",
Aiden looks suddenly terrified,
I...I can't go!,
"My dar told me if I bring the goats back to the farm, the chamberlain will slaughter them for food and it'll be the end for ma and dar!",
What if I talk to your father?,
It makes no difference,
I'm taking these goats to camp,
The young man shudders in relief,
I know of hidden trails - we'll be in the camp in no time!,
The goats start bleeting,
But we must hurry!,
Lead the way,
I’m not going to let you do that!,
The scrawny teen struggles to his feet brandishing his shepherd's staff,
If I lose these animals my dar’ll kill me!,
Don't do anything stupid now,
I need to rethink this,
Fine by me,
attack,
The boy shivers from cold and exhaustion,
Wh… what now?,
Why haven't you just left?,
About the animals,
I need to go,
The boy somehow looks even paler than he did last time you saw him,
I don’t know how much longer we can take it,
We need to talk?,
"The boy is clearly heartbroken, but he makes no effort to move",
"Alright, if that's what dar wants",
You'd do that for me?,
"Oh, Golden Dead bless you!!",
I'll be back soon,
My dar would kill me,
He sent me up here to keep the goats safe and I’m not leaving until he permits it!,
The lad’s eyes water up,

#HorrynAmbush,
"The men whirl around at the sound, and elation spreads across their faces as they spot you",
"Dragging their captives along, the reavers fan out around you with moronic grins and weapons drawn",
"One of them makes a piercing whistle and it's echoed by another behind you - a new group of six reavers file into the street, cutting off any chance you had at a retreat",
"You spring stealthily out of hiding, determined to get within killing range before your foes spot you",
Your heart pounds in your chest as you prepare to strike the first blow!,
But a piercing whistling cuts through the silence and stops you dead in your tracks,
"You whirl around to see another group of six reavers file into the street behind you, cutting you off from your escape route",
Elated laughter sounds from the first group as they notice the prey now caught between them and their comrades,
"The reavers fan out around you, dragging their captives along, with moronic grins and weapons drawn",
An 'end'?,
There are no ends here!,
Only new beginnings... new life!,
The men roar with laughter,
I am not,
But He is waiting for you,
He has so much to show you,
When you're ready,
We've come to put and end to you!,
"The man's breathing deepens in perverse delight as he pulls his hostage's head back by her long, auburn hair",
A thousand young will heed her call!,
He places the knife across the woman's throat,
A THOUSAND YOUNG WILL HEAR HER CALL!,
Stop!!,
"Before you can react, the big man slits the poor woman's throat",
Blood gushes forth as she stumbles towards you with utter panic in her eyes!,
Driina lunges towards her and frantically begins the hopeless task of stopping the bleeding,
"In the ensuing chaos, half of the wicked pack falls upon you from behind as the leader and a handful of his lackeys slip away with the surviving hostages",
"As you approach the city-square, panicked cries of fear, pain and despair echo across the plaza",
You move closer and spy a large group of reavers rounding up and binding villagers,
The poor souls are bloodied and abused and the reavers tie them in ranks as though they intend to march them away,
Call to the reavers,
"The brute stares at you for a moment, then smiles",
He stabs his dagger into the woman’s thigh and she screams in shock and pain,
Blood sprays uncontrollably from the wound as he pushes her roughly towards you,
"She stumbles into your arms, her face a mask of pleading and terror",
The wound is deep but she may yet be saved,
Attempt to bind her wounds!,
You cannot threaten me,
All that can change now is just how many vessels Father will offer up to Her by the day's end,
Can't you see?,
This is your chance to be part of something so much bigger than yourself!,
Fine - take them!,
Take the rest but leave the auburn woman,
You're all insane!,
The wound is too deep and the bleeding too severe,
The woman bleeds out in your arms,
As you look around the pack of reavers have fled with their hostages and the plaza now lies empty,
Driina holds the dead woman's hand as she recites a prayer under her breath,
The wound has cut one of the large blood vessels in her thigh and the situation is dire,
"Acting quickly, you loosen your belt and wrap it around her leg",
Using a stick you craft a tourniquet and manage to apply enough pressure to halt the bleeding,
The woman’s life has been saved,
You sit with the woman and catch your breath,
"Out of the fog, coming from the Fisherman’s Gate, a thin wretch of a man limps into view",
Natia!!,
By the Golden Dead: you saved her!,
Philip rushes to her side with tears streaming down his face,
"No doubt, the poor man followed you into the city to look for his wife",
She needs a safe place to rest!,
Our old home is nearby,
It will have to do!,
Philip picks up his wife and leads you a short way through the mist to a meager home,
As you follow Driina places a hand on your shoulder and offers a soft smile,
"A small reprieve amongst all this suffering, no?",
One of the struggling captives manages to break free,
She is swiftly caught and her throat slit for the trouble,
The other captives cry out in terror,
"Laughing, the reavers pull the rest to their feet and make for the opposite side of the square, towards the keep that looms over Horryn",
"We must act now, or all will be lost!",
Driina hisses,
Stay hidden,
"As the cries of the captives echo across the empty square, you tread cautiously back the way you came",
A whistle cuts painfully through the eerie silence,
"You whirl around to see another group of six reavers file into the street behind you, cutting off your retreat",
"Elated laughter spills from the first group, as they turn back to exult in their freshly caught quarry",
"As the cries of the captives being dragged away echo in the empty square, Driina looks you straight in the eyes, measuring your resolve",
"Before you can muster a response, she steps from your hiding place",
Her voice booms across the square,
By the Golden Dead - stand and answer for your crimes!,
"The man's voice rises, speaking as much to the other reavers as to you",
"We stand at the dawn of a new age - of old masters, reclaiming their rightful thrones!",
And you will all play your part in ushering it in,
The hooded man smiles cruelly at Driina,
The reavers close in around you,
This ends now!,
What now?,
Steady on,
"Roland whispers as he grabs your wrist, pulling you back into the shadows",
There's plenty more of them than us - attacking head on is a poor bet even for me,
Wait till they move and we'll take their rear,
Might even the odds before they know what's hit 'em,
We'll wait!,
We attack now!,
Not in a rush to die anymore Roland?,
Roland scowls,
"I may be shitty company, but that doesn't mean I'm happy to let my comrades throw their lives away on a whim",
The man points his blade at you,
We will meet again soon!,
"He whistles loudly and the pack sets off at a run, driving the hostages before themselves like pigs to the slaughter",
Roland puts a heavy hand on your shoulder,
If we had fought them it would have been the end of the hostages,
"Now, at least, we may yet have a chance to rescue them",
Behind you Driina sinks to her knees and sobs from rage and helplessness,
You tell yourself that combat would certainly have resulted in the death of the hostages,
At least now you may yet find a second chance to rescue them,
"A hulk of a man steps to the fore, dressed only in ragged trousers and a half hood",
His swollen barrel chest is covered in sailor tattoos,
"He hefts a rusty serrated dagger, and drags a terrified woman behind him by her auburn hair",
"He smiles serenely as he approaches, revealing a few remaining, yellow teeth",
You have no idea how glad I am to see you here!,
There is no scorn or malice in his voice,
Only genuine joy,
You're truly blessed to be a part of this,
"He slowly, almost tenderly places the knife against the womans throat as he speaks",
Are you the one they call 'Father'?,
A part of what?,
The man's breathing deepens in perverse delight as he pulls his hostage's head back by her long auburn hair,
We bring these children to Father’s flock,
You are free to roam and frolic with my brothers and sisters,
I’m sure Oleg or Kala will welcome you with open arms!,
Let the villagers go!,
Not a chance!,
#HorrynReaverChief1,
Oh the Butcher’s a good boy but he’s truly gone astray,
Blood-drunk I say,
I’ve seen it before,
"Once you taste the flesh and blood and guts of the weak, your hands just start going by themselves",
Becomes like gutting fish,
Knife in - knife out,
Oleg smiles broadly as he imitates a sawing motion with his hand,
But the Father still needs him - The tablets are whispering it to me!,
"Seek him out in front of the temple, over in the western part of town, and tell that to him!",
I have some other questions,
About the other chieftains,
A shadow falls over Oleg’s face,
Father is a great man,
I was the one to receive the word from the Deep but Father was the one who was truly chosen,
I won’t lie,
I was jealous!,
I hated him for it!,
The tablets came to me after all!,
Why was he the one to receive the gift?!,
What is his 'work'?,
He sighs,
"Then again, his work is so important",
So… beautiful even I cannot begin to comprehend it,
And we must all play our part in it,
My siblings will fall in line and you have been chosen for the task,
Oh do not worry!,
You’ll meet him soon enough and all will be made clear,
It is whispered,
Sweet little sister Kala!,
She and her brood caught more of the prey than any other!,
Sniffed them out from their cellars and attics and cupboards and sent them to Father!,
Though he only takes the fit,
The very young and very old were left for her to play with,
Oleg chuckles genially,
I fear she’s grown bored and lazy now that there’s hardly more prey to be had,
She just sits around and stews over in the pack-house on the docks now,
It’s time she was reminded that she has a role to play yet!,
Prey?,
Do you mean people?,
The old man smiles serenely and appears to either not hear or not comprehend your question,
The filthy pack of robed and hooded mad-men roar in insane anger and charge towards you as they draw strangely curved blades and cruel looking axes!,
Tell me about Kala!,
Tell me about the Butcher!,
Tell me about the Father!,
I have other questions,
The band of madmen file out of the lodge and into the city,
"Keeping your distance, you follow them as they set up an ambush in the plaza",
"Like mangey, starving wolves they fidget with the anticipation of bloodshed",
Finally their quarry arrives,
The Butcher and his filthy brood prowl into the square with weapons drawn,
An arrow is loosened and then mad cries from the ambushers fill the air as a furious melee erupts!,
Savage blades make bloody work,
"Intestines spill, blood pours and limbs are torn from bodies",
Screams of pain and terror mix with the howls and snarls of men utterly lost to insane bloodlust,
The Butcher finds Oleg on the field and with a mighty swing the old man is slain,
"As the fiend tears his ‘brother’s’ hearth from his chest, he howls in triumph",
"As the screams die down and all the savagery is sated, the ground is slick with blood",
Hulking and dark with grime and gore the Butcher stands panting in the center of the battlefield surrounded by his few surrounding men,
In the darkness his eyes burn like white hot coals,
"As he raises his bloody axe towards you, an inhuman scream echoes across the plaza",
It seems the mad-man has one more sacrifice yet to make!,
Attack!,
What?!,
My patience is limited!,
About your tablets,
Regarding the other chieftains,
I'm here to end you!,
It's time I left,
"An old man,graying but endowed with a physique sculpted by a lifetime of hard manual labor, looks up at you as you approach",
A smile of genuine surprise spreads warmly across his face in a manner that stands in stark contrast to the grotesque surroundings,
Ah!,
You came!,
You were expecting me?,
Your coming was whispered,
Such are the blessings of the Depths,
Cast your nets and receive the bounty,
All my life I’ve been at sea,
Wind and rain and frozen fingers,
And let me tell you,
Them Imperial hymns never did me any good,
Twasn't afore we started using the old incantations that the Deep started rewarding us,
And rewarded me it did,
The Whispering Tablets came to me,
That’s where we first received the deep word and that’s where I heard of your coming,
Whispering tablet?,
The Butcher has stolen your tablets!,
Aye,
The words of the Deep - written in stone,
Given to me and me alone,
"Those two upstarts, Kala and that butcher, covet it and even the Father himself pretends he no longer needs it",
No longer needs me,
A flash of anger comes across the face of the kindly old man,
But I’ll remind him,
I’ll make the Father remember,
How?,
Sister Kala and brother Butcher have lost their way,
All the bloodshed has gone to their heads and they’ve strayed!,
Lost their way!,
"Meanwhile, the Father has gone to the keep to begin the holy work",
He’s left it to me to put my wayward siblings right,
Or put them down,
Like diseased dogs,
And you think I'll help you?,
It does not matter what I think,
The tablets whispered and here you are,
Before this is over you will have more blood on your hands,
So much more blood,
Go to them,
Tell them to return to the family or suffer the consequences,
The Butcher is culling the flock in front of the temple and you’ll find Kala holding court at the east-end of the docks,
Begone now and do not return until you are done,
Not so fast,
I have questions!,
Oleg pauses a moment and then smiles conspiratorily,
Kala!,
"Together we’ll slay brother Butcher and once we feast on his putrid entrails, she’ll make a fine consort for old Oleg!",
Go to her!,
Tell her that together we shall put an end to the Butcher’s obstinance and win Father’s favor!,
What do you want?,
I have some questions!,
The robed cultists stop dead in their tracks as they spot you,
You,
You're not supposed to be here!,
Come here so I can gut you!,
Oleg sent me!,
INTERLOPER!,
DIE!,
"The Reavers appear taken aback, not knowing what to say",
"Instead they say nothing, whirl around and clamber up the ladder leading to the surface",
What in the depths are you doing back here?!,
To arms lads!,
Yes?,
I've taken the tablets for myself!,
Can I see them?,
Tell me more about them!,
The man eyes you suspiciously,
They’re none of your fucking business is what they are!,
They came to me and me alone!,
It was MY nets that caught them and my boat that carried them ashore!,
"Not the Butcher, not Kala and not even Father himself!",
ME!,
Oleg wipes a drop of sweat from his brow,
"Now, you best get going",
"He offers a polite, slight smile",
I have more questions!,
Oleg chuckles fatherly,
"Oh my, no",
They are for me and me alone,
They lie in darkness; safe and untouched by the filth of my wayward siblings,
What can you tell me about them?,
I had some other questions,
The man’s eyes widen in shock and rage,
What have you done!?,
You’re unraveling the thread!,
Are you mad??!,
You’ll pay for this!,
Oleg instinctively senses the truth in your words and his eyes widen in shock and terror,
"Then, utter rage",
That upstart!,
I gave him a chance to come to my side and he betrays me instead?!,
And now you say he intends to make an offering of me?!,
We shall see who’s bones will be laid out in the sun to dry come dawn!,
"Children, sharpen your blades!",
We’ll get the jump on the upstart yet!,
Watch them leave,
What if you ask Kala to ally with you?,
#HorrynReaverChief1GateGuard,
The men lick their lips in greedy anticipation,
To arms!,
they bellow,
Yes you will,
Oleg is waiting for you inside,
The man offers a toothless grin,
"You spot a pair of reavers dressed in a bizarre assortment of ragged robes, hoods and antlered masks guarding the gate to what appears to be a decrepit villa",
The pair notices you and they grin cruelly as they heft their weapons before suddenly stopping,
The antlered man leans in and whispers in the hooded one's ear,
Their grins fade,
You’re welcome to our lodge!,
He’s been expecting you,
What?,
Iben looks tense and whispers out of the corner of his mouth,
We got lucky before,
These madmen are not to be trifled with and we will do well to employ some cunning in dealing with them,
Roland chimes in,
Little man's right,
I’m not afraid to get my hands dirty but we are few and we don’t know their true numbers yet,
We shall see,
Oleg’s a great man!,
The Father might have forgotten it but he is the oldest of us,
Was him who pulled the tablets out of the depths and he’s still their keeper,
"And as long as he is, his word carries more weight than any of us!",
The Father would do well not to forget that!,
Tablets?,
The man smiles serenely,
No need,
Oleg hisself is waiting for you inside,
Go to him now,
I had some more questions,
The men look puzzled,
Why would we?,
Oleg says not to and his words come from the depths themselves,
He had the tablets even before the father came to us,
What tablets?,
Tell me more about Oleg!,
You mustn't tarry,
Oleg very much wishes to speak with you,
Tell me more about this Oleg!,
Why are you not attacking me?,
I have no time for you madmen!,
The whispering tablets,
Ones that came up in our nets,
From the deep and the Mother herself!,
The ones that make you,
The other reaver grabs his arm and he catches himself,
Best you see Oleg,
He’ll tell you all you needs to know,
#HorrynReaverChief2,
The woman snarls and bares her fangs as she draws a wickedly curved blade and lunges at you!,
The woman in front of you is tall and sinewy,
Her face is painted and bloody and her teeth have been filed into fangs,
She licks her lips greedily as you approach,
So what have we here?,
Fresh playthings for the brood?,
Come to taste the blade?,
The Butcher has stolen the tablets from Oleg,
Oy!,
Don’t you know who you’re talking to?,
One of the flanking reavers spit in your direction,
This is Queen Kala herself and you’re about to have the honor of being gutted by her!,
The assembled reavers howl and jeer,
I'll be the one doing the gutting!,
Silence!,
Kala yells in a voice that could cut glass,
The reavers scuttle fearfully into the shadows,
I am bored,
You will entertain me; One way or another,
Did one of my 'siblings' send you?,
Siblings?,
Did Oleg’s tablets command him to send you?,
Or was it the Butcher perhaps?,
So busy with the slaughter that he sends others to do his knife-work for him?,
I bring word from Oleg,
He reminds you that he holds the Whispering Tablets and that you owe him your allegiance,
The woman flashes her disfigured teeth in a savage gesture,
Oleg is king of shit,
"The old man’s teeth have gone soft and if the Father’s eye is still on any of us, it’s not on Oleg any more",
That’s for sure,
Kala picks her nails with a dagger for a moment,
But what do I care,
Butcher will sort him out soon enough and then he’ll become Fathers favorite,
The Butcher will kill Oleg?,
She grins widely,
Oh there will be plenty of blood and guts,
Don’t you worry!,
But more than anything it’s those tablets Oleg has the Butcher wants,
Them ‘Whispering Tablets’,
The Butcher knows the brethren will flock to him if he nabs them from Oleg,
And he’s plenty strong to take them but he’s afraid Father will get mad if he makes too much of a mess getting them,
What are you saying?,
Father wants order in the flock and he wants the one with the tablet to enforce it,
"Thing is, Oleg is too weak",
The only one strong enough to force us all in line is the Butcher but he don’t have the tablets!,
See?,
It’s the irony of the fates,
If the tablets were to fall into Butcher’s hands however… the bloodshed would be magnificent,
Her eyes seem to glimmer for a moment,
I think I'll just kill you!,
I'll be leaving then,
Kala erupts into cruel laughter,
Oh I'll join him and we’ll make a bloody mess of Oleg!,
And when the Butcher feasts on the old fool’s liver he’ll be so certain he’s won Father’s favor that he might not even feel my blade between his ribs,
There will be only one of us left standing tonight!,
Kala and her brood of reavers stalk their way into the main plaza of the city where they are met by the Butcher and his lot,
You follow from a distance and see the two reavers exchange words,
Then Kala slips into the mist and darkness and the Butcher forms his men up in a crude line,
"Soon, Oleg and his band approach from the east",
"Stalking cautiously into the plaza, towards the Butchers line, the two men exchange a few crude words before an arrow flies and carnage erupts",
"As the fiend tears his ‘brother’s’ heart from his chest, he howls in triumph",
"Then from out of the shadows, Kala and her brood fall upon the remainder of Olegs men from the rear",
The slaughter is complete and total and not a soul from Oleg’s band is left standing,
"As the screams die down and all the savagery is sated, the ground is slick with blood and gore",
"Kala stalks the battlefield like a savage animal, making short work of the wounded while the Butcher stands panting in the center of the plaza",
"In the darkness their eyes fix upon you, burning like white hot coals",
Kala raises her bloody sword towards you and lets out an inhuman scream,
It seems they have one more sacrifice yet to make!,
"Butcher’s too strong for either of us to slay on our own, but if I join Oleg",
A smirk spreads across her face,
Together we’ll lay that pile of fat low and then I’ll deal with Oleg myself!,
"Father will finally see that, all along, it was little Kala who was deserving of his love!",
Kala lets out a terrible war-cry and her brood joins her with weapons raised,
Kala and her band of reavers stalk their way into the main plaza of the city where they are met by Oleg and his lot,
Then Kala slips into the mist and darkness and the Oleg forms his men up in a crude line,
"Before long, the Butcher and his band approach from the west",
He gives a mighty bellow as he spots Oleg and charges head-long into the fray with his men at his heels,
"Then from out of the shadows, Kala and her brood fall upon the Butcher’s lot",
"With the reflexes of a serpent, Kala lunges at the Butcher and plunges her blade into his fat neck",
"A killing blow for sure, but Kala’s eyes widen in terror as, instead of toppling over, the Butcher grabs her by the knife-arm",
She desperately tries to pry her arm loose but to no avail!,
"Blood sprays from the Butcher’s mouth as he strains from the effort and with a wet, sickening snap, Kala’s arm is torn from her body",
They both collapse - dead,
Suddenly all is quiet,
You’ve defeated the three Reaver chieftains,
Now Father awaits,
You?!,
Out with it!,
Her eyes narrow,
Yes!,
I sense it!,
There is blood in the water and soon there will be blood in the streets!,
Finally we will be done with this petty bickering and Father will let us join him in the keep!,
The Butcher wants you to join him in stamping out Oleg,
Oleg asks you to join him against the Butcher!,
#HorrynReaverChief3,
I’ll drink your marrow and tear your flesh!!!,
Give them to me!,
His meaty hands tremble with excitement as he greedily takes the tablets from you,
"Mesmerized, he traces the grotesque carvings with fat, blood-smeared fingers",
I hear you!,
Your will shall be done!,
"The assembled reavers gather around and begin a low, droning chant",
He looks up at you with black eyes,
My ascent to Father’s side begins!,
Soon I’ll join him in the keep,
All that is left is the sacrifice of the firstborn,
Go to Kala!,
Tell her she will be at my side and together we’ll make an offering of Oleg and his pathetic little band!,
Tell her this is a knife night!,
A red night!,
Now go!,
We must make ready!,
"A beast of a man, bald and covered in crude sailor’s tattoos stands wide legged on the stairs of the desecrated temple",
You come to the Butcher willingly?,
Like some lamb crawling into the mouth of a wolf?,
Perhaps there is something about you?,
Tell me,
Why are you here?,
Oleg sent me to remind you that as long as he holds the Whispering Tablets you owe him allegiance,
I am the butcher of the weak,
It has fallen to me to cull those that are too feeble to join Father in the keep,
With cleaver and fire I do his bidding like an obedient son,
Or dog,
But he’ll call upon me soon enough and I’ll be at his side doing the holy work inside the keep!,
The Butcher’s eyes flicker to the tall walls of the keep to the south,
I just have to bring my upstart siblings in line first,
Father hates bickering,
How do you intend to do that?,
Kala and Oleg,
He spits in disgust,
Kala is fierce,
Caught many of the weak and gave me the ones Father could not use,
I’ll not soon forget that,
Her sin now is idleness,
She and her brood sit there in their rat hole on the docks bored and stewing,
I’ll deal with her in time,
Oleg is first,
What of him?,
He’s the oldest of us - and the weakest,
However he was also the one to drag the Whispering Tablets from the seas,
Came up in his nets when he was fishing and he was the first to hear the word from the Deep,
He may have had his role to play but it’s over for him now,
It’s time the tablets came to their rightful owner,
It’s time they came to me,
And all the rest of the brethren will flock to me and Father will see I’m the one deserving of his love,
Not that gray fool!,
The Butcher’s eyes narrow predatorily,
What are you thinking?,
The man’s laughter booms throughout the plaza,
Is that what he said?,
That decrepit old fool is owed nothing except my axe through his head,
Father favors me and me alone and that piss-stinking old man shall be my offering to him,
But I’ll give him this,
The Whispering Tablets do indeed hold the word from the Deep,
The brethren will flock to whomever possesses them,
And Father’s favor will follow,
You may have a role to play in this yet,
I see it in your face - around your eyes,
Seek out the Whispering Tablets,
Oleg hoards them well but I know where,
There are tunnels under his lodge,
Deep tunnels,
A canny cutter like you would do well in looking for the hidden entrance,
That is if you don’t mind wading through more shit,
Could you be more clear?,
I already have the tablets!,
I've had enough of you madmen!,
You’ll find a way,
I smell it on you,
Go now!,
Find the tablets and bring them to me - Quick and quiet,
There will be plenty bloodshed but I will be the one spilling the blood once the tablets are safe in my hands,
"Now, begone!",
Have you talked to Kala?!,
You must go to her!!,
Talk!,
I have the tablets!,
#HorrynSpiral1,
As you try to leave crabs swarm past you,
They consume the strange symbol ravenously,
They leave,
"Entering what appears to be a fishmongers' hall, your noses are immediately assaulted by a putrid stench far beyond the expected nautical aromas",
"The room is but dimly lit, and as shadows dance in the corners it becomes apparent that the floor in front of you is covered in parts and innards from fish and other creatures of the sea",
"As your eyes slowly adjust, you discern that the heaps of fetid offal have been carefully arranged into a peculiar shape",
Examine the shape more closely,
"Retching and gagging, you immediately leave",
YOU PICK UP THE ITEM,
"However, the clacking noises have become louder and more insistent",
"The slick, gleaming carapaces of enormous crabs suddenly flood the room",
No doubt drawn in by the smell,
OR SOMETHING ELSE,
Prepare for combat!,
"Striving to avoid slipping on the blood-slicked floor, you fully enter the hall and investigate the overall shape of the piles of fish guts with a discerning eye",
The parts are clearly arranged into a massive spiral - an ancient symbol of fertility and the sea,
"At the center of the spiral sits a particularily bloated and decayed octopus, its arms splayed outwards in all directions",
You can hear faint clacking,
Something seems to be moving nearby,
Further examine the octopus,
"Leave, quickly",
"Like a monstrous egg, the swollen and very dead octopus sits at the center of the disgusting spiral",
"A swift kick upends it, revealing something beneath: a large, rusty key!",
Pick up the key,
"Striving to avoid slipping on the blood-slicked floor, you fully enter the hall and investigate the overall shape of the piles of fish guts",
"After a few moments it strikes you - they are arranged, obviously with great care and effort, into a massive spiral",
"Why, you have no idea",
#HorrynSurvivorCora,
You cautiously begin to search for any potential hiding places but have no luck,
"Kat sighs, her expression troubled “What a shame",
She looked like she could have used our help,
Give up and leave,
You cautiously begin to search for any potential hiding places,
The girl must be here somewhere,
You startle as a cry of pain echoes behind you,
You little shit!,
"Roland shouts, clutching his hand to his chest as he backs away from a pile of trash",
"The girl darts out a second later, trying to slip between you",
Kat throws herself at the girl and grabs hold of her before she can escape,
"Determined not to be outmaneuvered again, you grab hold of the girl’s arm before she can make her escape",
Sharp teeth dig into the flesh of your hand as you reach into a pile of rags,
"The girl dashes from her hiding place, trying to slip away again",
"The girl struggles against your grip, snarling at you as you attempt to speak with her",
"She can be no older than 13 winters, but her emaciated frame and grime-covered skin make it hard to tell",
"The girl glares up at Kat with wide, scared eyes",
"Poor thing,",
"Kat says, patting her arm, “you must be starving",
Are you hungry?,
offer some food,
I don't think I can help you right now,
"You give chase through the narrow alleyways, scrambling to keep up with the agile girl, but she is too fast; she disappears into the shadows before you can catch up to her",
Search the alley,
Give up,
It doesn’t take long for you to catch up to the girl in the maze of back alleys,
"Cornered, she glares at you, her lips curling in a feral snarl",
Don’t harm her!,
Kat whispers as she moves towards the girl slowly with her hands up in front of her in a disarming gesture,
"As you pass the darkened alley, you feel the eyes of someone watching you",
"Peering into the shadows, you can just make out the form of what appears to be a little girl in dirty, torn clothing",
"Before you can get a closer look, the girl flees, disappearing into the darkness beyond",
Kat grabs your cloak,
We have to follow her!,
Ignore it and move on,
The girl seems unwilling to talk,
Perhaps if she had some food in her belly?,
"You look around the alley, ears straining for any sign of reavers nearby",
"The thought of leaving the girl behind is not a comfortable one, but it is wiser than trying to drag her through hostile territory",
"For now, she is as safe as she can be",
"Once the Reavers started fighting amongst themselves, they blocked off the streets",
"Made it real hard to get around unseen, but I'm no fool",
Cora smiles mischievously,
I suspect not,
She seems pleased at the compliment,
"It's too dangerous and hard to travel the streets, but under them is another thing",
"There’s tunnels all under the city and if you don't mind the stench and avoid the beasties, they’ll take you wherever you need to go!",
Clever girl,
"The girl still seems hesitant as she looks up at you. “....Cora,",
"she says, her voice low",
"But I hate it, so everybody calls me Cory. ‘Cept my ma, that is",
And where's she now?,
As soon as the question leaves your lips you realize the mistake,
You don’t push for the answer and Cora does not offer one: the silence says everything,
Kat gently strokes the child’s hair,
The girl snatches the food from you like a frightened animal and wolfs it down,
More!,
she growls,
"Ah, so the girl has a tongue after all!",
"Kat offers the girl a small, reassuring smile",
"Don’t worry, girl",
You can have as much as you like,
Are you ready to answer some questions?,
"The girl absentmindedly fiddles with something, but her eyes are sharp and watchful",
No doubt she knows a lot about the town having survived here for so long,
What's your name?,
Tell me about the Reavers?,
How have you been moving around?,
"The girl looks up at you with large, tear-filled eyes",
They mostly come out at night,
Mostly,
she hugs her arms around herself,
At least... they used ta,
I don’t see ‘em as much anymore,
Not since they started fightin’ each other,
Fighting each other?,
"She nods, her gaze distant",
One day they just turned on each other,
"Started killin’ their own instead of huntin’ people….now, though, they seem to be holed up in different parts of the town",
Almost as if…as if they’re waitin’ for somethin’,
One group seems to stay on the docks,
They’re led by a woman named Kala I think,
"I saw ‘er, once",
Never knew women could look so cruel,
"she pauses, worrying at her lower lip",
"Beside’ them, there’s another band holed up in that old walled house over there - ” she points to the north-east",
A gray-haired man called Oleg leads them,
Are there more?,
"There are men outside the temple, led by someone they call ‘the Butcher’",
They…they’ve been doing horrible things,
Burning,
she trails off before shaking her head,
"They’ve blocked off the streets leading to the temple, so those men don’t come to this part of the city anymore",
Cora offers you a slight smile,
Her cheeks have regained a modcium of colour; it seems getting some food in her belly seems to have done her a world of good,
I have some questions for you!,
"Cora is huddled in the corner, her stick-thin arms wrapped around her knees",
She slinks further into the shadows at the sight of you,
Offer some food,
#HorrynSurvivorNatia,
Natia is pale and drawn,
She must have lost a lot of blood,
"However, her wound is securely bound and she is in relative safety",
"If it is within her to recover, she will",
Do you think you could answer some questions for me?,
I'll help you as best I can,
What can you tell me of the men who took you?,
It's time to go!,
Farewell!,
Natia looks tired and pale but nonetheless in much better shape than when you first met her,
She offers a weak smile as a greeting,
I had some questions for you!,
I just wanted to check in on you!,
I did hear something!,
The man who stabbed me was taking us to the keep - to ‘meet Father’,
But he was angry that the Reavers in the city itself had taken to infighting,
Split up into groups they had,
Fighting over ‘tablets’ or some such items he said,
"And what’s more, I heard him say that the tablets were currently in the possession of a Reaver he called Oleg",
Oleg the Gray or something to that effect,
Thank you for your help,
#HorrynSurvivorPhilip,
Thank you so much for saving Natia’s life,
I could not have gone on without her,
"Please, take this as a token of my gratitude!",
Philip produces a gold ring and offers it to you,
Accept the ring,
Keep it!,
Decline reward,
The man looks stunned for a moment then smiles and bows to you in gratitude,
You're a fool to turn down pay for a job well done,
Roland grumbles behind you,
I have some questions before we go,
Farewell,
Ask me anything you like and I'll help you if I can!,
Will you be safe here?,
Is there anything more you can tell me about the Reavers?,
I need to get going,
Not much!,
The ones you met were part of Father’s lot,
The ones holed up in the Keep,
But you should ask Natia!,
She might have heard something while they held her,
Philip seems to have regained some of the color in his face,
He gently wipes Natia’s brow with a wet piece of cloth,
It is good to see you again!,
I needed to ask you some questions!,
Just wanted to check in,
Goodbye!,
The city is far from safe but Natia is too severely wounded to travel,
"Besides, from what you tell me, it seems nowhere is safe on this blasted island",
"Besides, the Reavers seem to be holed up in their separate parts of town for now",
I pray the Golden Dead will grant you the strength to prevail against them,
Good!,
The man bows deeply as he gives you the ring,
There are no doubt countless golden rings in your future,
I doubt the same can be said of these people,
Driina offers in a lecturing tone,
#ReaverZombieScene,
Driina walks up to one of the wretches and examines her grimy face,
I know this woman,
She used to live in Horryn,
By the Golden it is as if their minds are broken,
The woman offers no sign of understanding and simply shambles away,
The wretch stares at you with vacant eyes and mouth half agape,
Kill,
"You emerge into a large, natural cavern and your senses are immediately assaulted by the stench of human filth",
"Ahead, in the darkness of the cave, you see dozens of shambing forms milling purposelessly about",
They don’t appear to notice you,
At the far side of the roiling mass of filthy bodies you spot another barred door and from beyond it a strange lambent glow seems to be emitting,
#,
# Chapter_1_HorrynCrypt,
#,
#HorrynCryptBloom,
You awaken with a start,
You are lying sprawled on the cold stone floor of the tomb,
"There is no telling how long you’ve been there, but the irritation in your eyes and lungs has subsided",
"Kat grabs your arm, wild-eyed and tears streaming",
"She tries to say something, then gives up",
Get up,
Driinas face is wet from sweat as she continually and wordlessly recites some prayers,
"As you address her, she stops suddenly and fixes you with her gaze",
This is madness given form,
"And in this, the most sacred of places",
The home of the dead!,
She draws her breath and seems to compose herself,
We must venture to stamp out this foulness,
What can we do?,
This city is built on ancient foundations,
There are crypts below that are far more ancient than this,
That must be where this abomination is being spawned,
"Then again, this is no coincidence",
"Whatever madness has befallen Idra, this is all part of that same curse",
"And for now, there are still living that need our aid!",
"As much as it pains me to leave this foulness alive in the crypt, we must press onwards and through to the castle",
All I ask is this,
"Once we retake the city, we will come back here and restore the sanctity of this place!",
I'm with you Driina!,
"As you scramble to your feet, you have a chance to take in the strange growths that fill the chamber for the first time",
Examine the tentacles,
"Alien, tentacle-like roots burst obscenely from the floor before branching off into a myriad of smaller partitions that seem to spread throughout the entire complex",
"The growths seem to writhe with peristaltic motion and as you draw near, strands lift up and reach greedily towards you",
You've seen this before,
In the well near the farmhouse where you landed on Idra,
"{PLAYER}, lets be on our bloody way yeah?",
Kat spits as she backs away towards the door,
Examine the tentacles more closely,
You fail to learn anything new about the strange organism,
The growths seem to shudder with anticipation,
Perhaps you have read of this before?,
Have you encountered this in nature somewhere?,
"Driina, what is happening here?",
"A fine dust whirls up as you progress through the chamber, filling your eyes and nose with a burning sensation that sends you into an uncontrollable fit of sneezing and eventually, retching",
The sound booms in the echoing chamber and makes your ears ring as stars flash before your eyes,
"As you reel to escape the invasive spores, you end up crawling on hands and knees towards the exit",
"A mist seems to be filling the room, or is it simply your vision fading to black?",
Fight the sensation,
This organism defies any known taxonomy,
But there are books,
"Forbidden books, that speak of such things",
Algion of Yrr wrote of how he saw vast squirming masses shift in the pale light of distant stars,
"And certain, unspeakable Shaddu-Wahit texts talk of the “crawling doom” that came to Errawhan",
You shudder - it is best not to think of such things,
"Strangely, through the dim veil, you see something",
Basalt towers loom across a dead landscape,
A strange piping reverberates through all your being,
"As you crawl on hands and knees, you can clearly feel the cold tile floor of the crypt",
Yet you find yourself... elsewhere,
Now a wind blows across the blasted desolation,
"Standing just ahead of you, yet impossibly far away, is a tall figure dressed in flowing tattered robes",
It raises its hand towards its face and again the strange piping sounds,
All is black,
"You manage to cover your face with a piece of clothing and as you shield your face from the impossible vista in the mist, you struggle to gain control of your breathing",
A howling wind mixes with the piping and for a moment you hear the fluttering of tattered robes,
Instinctively you continue covering your eyes,
"Then, cutting through the maddening noise you hear a voice as clear as crystals",
Drinna is reciting a prayer,
"Then, as suddenly as it started, all is silent",
Relief floods through you as you look up and find yourself still in the darkened tomb chamber,
Kat grabs your arm with wild-eyes,
"She looks as if she's going to say something, then gives up",
You do not know what to make of the strange organism before you,
"It most closely resembles some strange fungal growth, but even that is only in the most general of terms",
You have never seen anything like it before,
"In fact, you feel certain that this “thing” is utterly alien to our world",
"From whence it came however, you can only guess",
#HorrynCryptEmbalming,
Driina begins searching through a pile of tomes on a nearby table,
"Her face, still ashen-grey, pales even further as her attention turns to the corpse in the center of the room",
"Driina, what is this room?",
Driina presses her palms lightly against her face before removing them in a gesture that reminds you of an unmasking,
An embalming chamber,
This is where our acolytes preserve the sacred flesh of our dead,
"Driina does not look at you as she speaks, her attention already reclaimed by one of the tomes",
"For those touched by the Reticulum, the veil between the living and the dead is thinner",
"Though the flesh may die, an….echo persists",
"With a shake of her head, Driina slams the book shut",
This is not the time for theology,
We must press on,
"Stepping into this room, you are at once terrified and awestruck by the alien-ness mixed with sanctity",
A room not meant for common eyes where the imperial priesthood plies it's strange and sacred rituals,
The room before you is like none you have ever seen,
"A creeping sensation tingles down your spine as you take in the terrifying array of ancient tomes, jars filled with strange liquids, and what appears to be a corpse wrapped in stiff, white cloth",
#HorrynCryptEnterFinalRoom,
"As you approach the entrance to the large vault, you can’t help but notice the slightest of drafts in the otherwise stale air of the crypt",
The secret tunnel must lie somewhere inside,
#HorrynCryptEntrance,
The corpse belongs to a young man with sunken cheeks and a shaved head,
A faded tattoo on his forehead marks him as an acolyte of the temple,
"His face is a mask of pain, terror or, more likely, both",
"As you carefully shift him, intestines spill out with a wet squelch",
Try to determine the cause of death,
Driina steps away from the corpse and whispers a prayer beneath her breath,
Her eyes are wide with fear as she takes in the mangled display before her,
This is not the work of Reavers…. something else is afoot,
This man tended the sacred flesh of the dead,
These tombs,
"she trails off, and then, as if deciding something, gives a sharp shake of her head",
Come,
We must find the cause of this carnage,
In the fluttering light of the tomb you can tell her face has turned ashen gray,
Let's be on our way,
Where to now?,
"The youth is too mangled to determine a cause of death, but it is clear from the sheer amount of blood at your feet that this was not a quick and painless end",
"After examining the corpse, you are horrified to discover the youth’s abdomen has been torn apart by claws or…fingers?",
"Stranger still are the thin, purple strands festering inside of the wound",
"As you enter the dimly lit crypt, your senses are immediately assaulted by the scent of fresh carnage",
The scent is still faint enough that you are sure whatever awaits you below has not been dead for long,
"Your suspicions are soon confirmed; at the foot of the stairs ahead of you lies the mangled remains of a man in white, bloodstained robes",
Examine the corpse,
"With one final glance at the corpse, you push aside your fear and delve into the blackness ahead",
The shadowy expanse of the crypt stretches before you,
"Whatever is happening here, you must venture deeper into the darkness if you wish to find your way into the Keep above",
Driina peers into the darkness ahead,
"I am unsure of the tunnel’s exact location, save that it lies somewhere in the deep crypts to the south",
"However, given what we have discovered here, I would advise we explore this level for clues before moving on",
#HorrynCryptFinal,
"The Wight King emits a roaring scream as, one by one, the lids of the surrounding sarcophogi fly open",
"In the lingering dust, five gaunt, yellow-fanged creatures emerge from their graves",
"Wishing to put an end to the tomb’s horrifying curse, you give the ancient sword to the King",
"He takes it from you eagerly, and then, with a final sigh that echoes eerily throughout the crypt, the ancient creature returns once more to his slumber",
Standing atop the stone dais is the emaciated form of what appears to have once been a King,
"Rust has long since destroyed much of its royal armor, and what little flesh remains on its skeletal form is covered in the same crawling, purple fungus that seems to infect these tombs",
DIE ABOMINATION!,
I command you to bring me the usurper’s blade,
Return without it and your life is forfeit,
The undead King has not moved from his place atop the dais,
The fungus growing within him seems to writhe with renewed vigor at your approach,
Why have you returned?!,
I have your sword!,
I've come to end you!,
You present the sword taken from Joran the Usurper’s tomb,
Is this the sword that was stolen from you?,
The Wight King surges forward,
The Lake Blade!,
Giiiivveee iiittt ttooo mmee!,
I'll keep it for myself,
Take it!,
You do not know?,
the wight bellows,
I am Enar,
"All-King, Lord of Idra, Wielder of the mighty Lake Blade!",
And why do you linger here?,
The wight emits a pained moan as he reaches for the empty sheath at his waist,
I shall not rest until I have reclaimed the blade Joran the Usurper stole from me!,
I have your blade!,
#HorrynCryptJunction,
"The terrifying sight of their clawed, bloodied fingers reaching toward you conjures the image of the torn-apart corpse at the crypt’s entrance",
"You steel yourself, determined you will not meet the same end",
Driina peers into the blackness straight ahead,
"These corridors lead to the crypt’s tombs, where we shall find the entrance we seek",
"Alas, I know not which path is the correct one, and which may lead us to….whatever madness lies ahead",
"Furthermore, the gate ahead appears to be locked",
The shuffling of bare feet on stone sounds from down the corridor to your left,
You are not alone,
Vague shapes linger just at the edge of darkness,
Who goes there?,
Driina shouts,
An unmistakable tremble has crept into her voice,
You arrive at a dimly lit junction with an intricate mosaic at its center,
Four paths lay before you,
"As you take in your surroundings, you notice fresh smears of blood leading into the eastern tunnel",
The path ahead is barred by a locked gate,
"Moving closer, you notice the faint flicker of movement out of the corner of your eye",
"Slowly, the shadows moving toward you morph into familiar, humanoid shapes",
Survivors?,
Or perhaps assailants?,
"You just manage to catch a glimpse of emaciated flesh and sharp, yellow fangs before the creatures are upon you",
#HorrynCryptLongCrypt,
LOREM IPSUM,
An exit!,
#HorrynCryptSecretTunnel,
#HorrynCryptSwordTomb,
Who drags me from the black stars!?,
screams the skeletal figure,
"As it emerges from the billowing dust, its regal, ancient armour seems to glimmer in the faint light",
A thousand curses are too few!!!,
The creature raises its sword in the air as it charges toward you!,
"Pushing as hard as you can, you are met with an unnatural resistance, almost as if something is holding the lid shut from within",
Perhaps there is another way of opening this tomb?,
"You are met with an unnatural resistance, almost as if something is holding the lid shut from within",
"Straining with all your might, you overpower the unknown force and stumble forward as the lid suddenly shifts",
"There is little time to catch your breath, for something is emerging from the newly opened tomb",
The beautifully carved sarcophagus before you features an effigy depicting a man with sharp aquiline features and a stern gaze,
Open the sarcophagus,
"Shouting the name, your voice echoes inside the vaulted crypt",
"For a moment, all is silent",
"And then, with a booming crack, the lid is violently flung open",
"The momentum sends you tumbling to the floor, leaving you desperately scrambling to regain your footing as something begins to emerge from the newly opened tomb",
"The lid begins to slide off as you push against it until, suddenly, a hissing screech emits from the interior of the sarcophagus",
The lid trembles violently as it is forced back into place by some unholy force within,
Someone or something is pitting its will against you!,

#HorrynReaverAltar,
This tablet has claimed many minds,
The Reavers were once sane men,
"Now they are murderous beasts and I know in my blood, this helped spark their madness",
She spits on the tablet,
I wonder... did they catch it in their nets by chance?,
"Or were there deeper, darker forces at work?",
Loot the altar,
Examine the artifact more closely,
A hideous simulacrum of an altar stands before you,
"The large stone slab is smeared with blood and feces, and obscenely decorated with the rotted eggs of sea birds and the bones of small creatures",
A small pile of coins and precious stones have been placed upon it as well,
"Its most striking feature, however, is the weathered, greenish stone tablet that serves as a centerpiece",
"Leaning in and in the dim light, you can make out line upon line of faint carvings and grotesque imagery covering the tablet",
It seems to writhe and contort in impossible ways and for a moment you can almost hear whispering,
Pull Away,
You pull back from the hideous artifact and for some reason your mind resounds with a single thought,
The tablet came from the unknowable depths of the sea,
No doubt an item of power and value... to the right person,
Driina shudders,
This is an artifact of pure evil,
"Driina, what is this thing?",
You carefully place the tablet in your bags before picking through the offal covering the rest of the altar for what precious items you find there,
Your bags feel heavy as you heft them over your shoulder,
You force yourself to scan the tablet and its hideous carvings,
The scripture makes little sense to you but there are images as well,
Suggestive images,
"However, you decide that you lack the required knowledge to make sense of them and quickly look away",
"Taking a deep breath, you force yourself to look upon the hideous carvings again",
You fail to make any further sense of the writing but your eyes linger on the crude renditions of humanoid figures,
"Some appear to be men, or at least man-like",
"Small and pathetic, they kneel in worship of others, much larger and monstrous figures",
"In another series of images, the subject matter becomes more disturbing still",
"Squatting obscenely, the larger horrors embrace the smaller men and in a grotesque imitation of lovers, it appears as if they are kissing deeply",
You feel nausea rising up and look away from the hideous tablet,
#HorrynSewerJack,
My badge indeed!,
The sewerjack grabs the badge and tries to wipe some of the grime off of it,
For a moment there I thought I was in real trouble,
Don’t you come closer now!,
The man cautioned as he brandished a mace,
He’s covered with grime from top to toe and looks oddly at home in the muck and filth of the sewers,
The odd man squints as he raises his lantern to get a better look at you,
Though you’re certainly not one of those mad-men!,
Begging your pardon my lord but one can’t be careful enough these days,
Begging your pardon my lady but one can’t be careful enough these days,
I'm glad you can tell the difference,
Spend too much time down here and your mind begins playing tricks on you,
Such is the life of a sewerjack I suppose,
Not that I’m much of one; having lost my badge of office and all!,
Badge of office?,
Do you mean this?,
Offer badge,
A brass badge that us sewerjack wear,
Tis’ a badge of our authority you know!,
The man puffs out his chest in the slightest,
"But as I said, mine’s lost",
Must have dropped it when I scuffled with that pack of vermin near those side tunnels to the east of here,
The man half-turns and shows you a large bloody gash torn across his back,
I think I've already found it!,
I'll keep an eye out,
But do you mind answering some questions first?,
These here sewers are a bit of a maze until you get to know them,
"But for the most part, as long you stay away from the beasties and muck, you can’t really get too lost",
All tunnels loop back to the central cisterns one way of another,
"And if you’re real clever-like, you can use the tunnels to get almost anywhere in the city",
There are three outlets that empty into the harbor,
The westernmost of them has planks that allow you to sneak out onto the docks,
"And if you need to get to the area by the temple, now that it’s blocked off and all, there is a side tunnel in the western part of the sewers that leads into a cellar near the temple",
"Finally, in the south-eastern tunnels, you might come across a staircase leading down into the Underhalls",
All kinds of queer folk can be found there,
Thieves and cutthroats and the like,
"They¨'re not Reavers though, mind you",
I hear they even have some kind of market down there where all kinds of wares can be had,
But I’d give them a wide berth if I were you,
Best not take any chances,
Ask away!,
What's a 'sewerjack' exactly?,
What's the layout of this place?,
Any Reavers down here?,
I have to get going,
They do come down here from time to time!,
It seems they’ve barricaded the city above off into sections and it seems using the sewers might be the easiest way to move between areas,
A small group of them came through here a few days ago,
I shadowed them for a bit but then they rounded a corner and before I could catch up to them they were gone,
Just like that,
"For the life of me, I don’t understand where they could’ve gone",
"I lost their trail north east of here, in the bend where the fungus-patches grow",
You’re back!,
Good to see you’ve kept your wits about you down here!,
I need to ask you some questions!,
I found your badge,
"Now listen, I don’t have anything of value on me except what’s in my noggin",
"Noone knows these sewers better than me, see, and the least I can do for you is give you this",
"He pulls out a piece of paper, scribbles some notes on it and hands it to you",
It appears to be a map of the sewers,
This should make it easier for you to find your way around here,
I have some questions now,
They pay us to keep the sewers free of vermin,
Human and otherwise!,
The man chuckles,
Used to be it was fine work if you could stand the smell!,
But not lately,
Sewers been overrun with beasties!,
"Overgrown, cruel, dangerous… monsters!",
I slew a leech the size of my leg the other day and a pack of rats nearly ended me just hours ago,
What's causing it?,
Causing it?,
the man says dreamily as if he’d never stopped to consider it before,
Sometimes… sometimes I wonder if… if it’s not been like this all along?,
"I mean, it hasn’t",
As I said: the darkness plays tricks on you down here,
Why are you still down here?,
The man seems to collect his thoughts again,
"I know these tunnels like the back of my hand and with the carnage going on above, this place is as safe as any I reckon",
Those Reavers are dangerous people and I’d rather take my chances down here for now,
#HorrynSewersEntrance,
You peer into the dark depths below,
The stench of raw sewage assaults your olfactory organs with such force that you struggle to keep your last meal down,
Kat looks up at you pale-faced,
You can’t be seriou…“ Before she manages to finish the sentence she whirls around and vomits,
Rolands laughter booms,
What's wrong girl?,
Lost your appetite for adventure?,
You clamber down the grimy ladder and emerge into a series of vaulted tunnels,
A thick bubbling greenish-brown stew lazily floats by you,
A river of filth expertly channeled away by the city-spanning sewer-system,
I wonder if the craftsmen of today still possess the knowledge to build tunnels such as these?,
Iben muses,
The Gallian Empire has become an empire of caretakers,
A ‘custodial empire’ who no longer builds,
Only frantically tries to fight off that great conqueror ‘decay’,
No?,
You doubt the builders and craftsmen of today are even capable of such feats of engineering anymore,
Continue on your way,

#Chapter1Smugglers,
We've been holed up in these bloody caves for too long - a little bloodshed might do us good,
"The furthest warriors draw their bows, as the lead figure strides towards you, blade in hand",
"Roland, any ideas?",
I yield!,
"None the less, trouble's found you",
And you're not leaving until she says so,
"So put down your weapons, or these tunnels are about to get very slippery",
You want them?,
Come get them,
Fine!,
We'll yield,
Smugglers,
Hold it!,
Comes a shout from the shadows ahead,
Move any closer and you'll move no more,
You can just make out the faint silhouettes of a group of armed warriors,
Forgive me - I'll leave!,
You have no idea who you're messing with,
We're the kind of folks who prefer to be left well alone,
The kind who don't brook no interference from strangers,
The figures creep slowly out of the murk,
Being able to see them better does not reassure you,
We're here to offer our services,
"If you want a fight, I'm happy to oblige?",
We're not looking for trouble,
Truly,
"Oh, it's not really that easy now is it?",
You know we're here now,
And you could be anyone,
"The voice trails off, and one of the figures makes a high-pitched chuckle",
You want to bleed?,
Just ask!,
"Listen, we're not looking for trouble",
You don't say?,
The voice coos,
"Tell me, little lamprey, do you know who you're dealing with here?",
Please enlighten me,
I don't care,
You all bleed the same,
I'm sure you are but the Queen will be the judge of that,
Now drop your fucking weapons and come with me!,
"If you want my weapons, come and get them!",
I'll yield,
There's a staccato laugh from the darkness,
"I can't deny we're in dire need of fresh blood, thanks to these interesting times",
I'd be happy to introduce you to the Queen herself - I'll even vouch for your enthusiasm,
"But by the Mother of Maelstroms, I can't let you go armed",
Guests!,
I would see you in my quarters,
Do not keep me waiting,
And Armand - let them keep their weapons,
Any decent assassin would have shut you up long ago,
Aye aye m'lady,
Armands offers a shallow bow,
You heard the lady,
Make yourself at home in our little corner of luxury,
Armand gestures towards the tunnels beyond with a theatrical gesture,
A womans voice rings through the caves with such authority that the would-be combatants stop dead in their tracks,
Armand!,
What is this nonsense?,
You'd add dead guests to the list of curses befalling us?,
Fool!,
Armand,
A deep voice rings out through the caves,
"Then, backlit by torches, you notice a woman overlooking the scenes from a high ledge",
"We have guests, I see",
"I think it would behoove us to treat them with what hospitality we can muster, no?",
You hear the shadowy sentinels immediately sheathe or stow their weapons,
"Aye, m'lady!",
the man called Armand calls back respectfully,
"Roland strides towards the oncoming assailant, his figure looming over him, making him seem more beast than man,",
Your archers might get me but I'll make damn sure you and I go together little man,
The shadowy figure stops dead in his tracks as Roland's voice rumbles menacingly through the tunnel,
"As you disarm, you find yourself at the mercy of the shadowy figures",
"Even through the darkness, you can make out the white teeth of the leader's cruel grin",
This was a bad idea,
"Out of the corner of your eye, you can see Iben shift ever so slightly to put you between him and your would be assailants",
#HorrynIagoCaptured,
Sitting on the cold floor is a man in heavy chains,
"As you approach, he looks up and from underneath his long unkempt hair his eyes glint and the vaguest outline of a smile flashes across his face",
Finally!,
I thought you’d never get here!,
You are my ticket out of this hole!,
And not a moment too soon I might add!,
The man shuffles to his feet and dusts himself off as if preparing to leave,
"First of all I have no idea what you’re talking about and secondly, surely you realize you’re chained up?",
A minor inconvenience!,
The Blind Maiden has brought you thus far and no doubt the rest of the solution to this little conundrum is about to present itself,
Iago zha Droma is not fated to spend the rest of his life rotting away in chains,
"If the Blind Maiden favors you so, how did you end up in this hole?",
The Maiden merely deals us our hands of cards; it is for us to play them,
"I, perhaps, played my last hand poorly",
A small lover’s quarrel stemming from a simple misunderstanding led to a series of unfortunate events that landed me here,
He rattles his chains as if to emphasize his plight,
But the Maiden kisses me again and here you are,
My rescue!,
"Oh, is that so?",
All I ask of you is that you intercede on my behalf to the Queen,
"Though she certainly loves me madly, she has also decided that I am to meet my end chained up in this oubliette shit-hole",
For the briefest of moments Iago loses his composure and the slightest hint of desperation creeps into his voice,
"Hold on, I have some questions first",
Iago looks at you impatiently,
Why exactly are you chained up here?,
Why should I help you?,
I'll be back,
Has the Blind Maiden ordained my freedom yet?,
Not yet but I have some questions first!,
Not yet,
There is not a sea on Warda untouched by Ombarian hulls,
I do not deny that we whisper tales of such things when we are safe on dry land with a cup of wine in our hands,
Of things older than time that dwell in the unfathomable depths of the seas,
"But to hear of one in this age, and to encounter it no less!",
Such things should not be,
It is madness given form,
A shadow passes over the man’s face,
Where is your ship now?,
I had some other questions for you,
We limped into a safe haven in one of this island’s excellent more ‘private’ coves,
My crew awaits there as we make repairs and forage for supplies,
Let’s just say there is a reason Idra is so prized amongst those who fly the black sails,
Iago winks at you,
So you’re a smuggler then?,
Kat blurts out with not a little awe in her voice,
Iago fixes her with sultry gaze,
Why 'smuggler' is such a vulgar term,
"I am a gentleman, a zhenor of the seas",
'Flying black sails' is a common euphemism for smugglers in the Empire,
What were you carrying?,
Do not think me a petty criminal for carrying proscribed goods,
There are men and women in this Empire who yearn for freedom from the yoke of their eunuch masters,
Freedom costs blood,
"As well as steel and other, more… exotic wares",
Men such as me provide them,
As does the ‘Queen’ in her own way,
We needed supplies and since she and I are old friends I made my way here to parlay a deal,
No doubt I overestimated our friendship,
Ah why indeed!,
Iago’s laughter comes out strained,
As I said: ‘tis nothing but a lover’s quarrel!,
A trifle,
I assure you,
"I am certain, if you intercede on my behalf to the Queen, and make sure to tell her I’m terribly regretful, she will see reason and let me be on my merry way",
I'm not sure I believe you,
Because Iago zha Droma is the finest captain to ever grace the Outer Isles with his sails,
"Besides, if you find another captain, brave or stupid enough to venture out to sea in these dire times, I shall dance on my mother’s grave!",
Iago leans in and his voice drops,
Horror stalks the depths around Idra,
I have seen it with my own eyes!,
I know,
It sunk our ship as we came in!,
Then you know what I speak of. ‘The Terror of Idra’,
"Many a ship must have shared your fate in these last, dark weeks",
It fell upon us as well when we passed Sylo’s Teeth,
Many of my men were swept off deck and large gouges were torn from the sides of my beautiful ship,
What happened?,
Were it not for the grit of my crew and the blessed ship-wrights who shaped the magnificent hull of the ‘Oruda’ we would have met our end as you did,
Instead we were able to slip from its grasp and make our way past the reefs and into shallower waters where the behemoth could not follow,
What is the nature of this behemoth?,
And where is your ship now?,
#HorrynRatMaze,
A circular chamber with three exits,
"The one to the west opens up into a larger, lit passage",
North,
East,
Exit west into the underhalls,
A bend in the tunnel leads south or east,
Drawn on the wall is a vulgar graffiti of two naked male forms that appear to be... wrestling,
South,
This room is a dead end,
Written on the wall in chalk is the graffiti,
Esteban is a donkey-fucker!,
"Besides the checkerboard patterned floor, this is an otherwise inconspicuous chamber with exits leading north and west",
West,
"A fairly large, vaulted chamber with four exits",
The floor seems sticky with some kind of slimy mold that appears to be spreading from a large drain,
A junction where three tunnels converge,
The Rat Queen rules here!,
The exit to the east smells faintly of sewage,
This is a dead end,
Nothing to see here,
A large square chamber with four central pillars,
A skeletal corpse sits leaning up against one of the pillars,
Tunnels lead off into all four cardinal directions,
"A large, octagonal chamber with four exits",
The one leading north stinks of sewage and leads back to the sewer tunnels,
A chalk arrow is drawn on the wall leading west,
Exit north into the sewers,
A chamber where the worked stone of the easter wall has collapsed causing dirt and rocks to spill into the room,
The wet stench of mold hangs thick in the air,
Tunnels exit to the north and west,
A tall chamber with a tapering ceiling,
"A beam of light shines down from above, illuminating a piece of chalk graffiti",
Magi have no balls - but fuck us nonetheless!,
Exits lead south and west and the one towards the west stinks of sewage,
You have emerged into the underhalls of Horryn,
Faint music can be heard ahead and the air smells of spice and perfume,
The narrow tunnels of the Rat-Raze opens up into the rancid sewers underneath Horryn,
The Rat Maze,
The tunnel leads back into “The Rat Maze,
Enter at your own risk!,
The tunnel ahead is dark and narrow and seems to be of pre-imperial construction,
Rats scuttle in and out and ahead you can see it branching in multiple directions,
"If you proceed, you must keep your wits, and sense of direction, about you",
#HorrynRatQueenScene,
SOmething about C,
More about C,
Finally the last part about C,
How curious: you're clearly not from Idra; you've not made the mistake of attacking us; you appear not to know me,
I seek answers,
I seek fortune,
I doubt you’ll find much in these halls,
"Nonetheless, you are welcome to enjoy my hospitality and... business",
So long as your blade stays in your sheath and your tongue remains courteous,
The queen takes a long draw from a hookah pipe as she stares intently at you,
Thank you m'lady,
May I ask you some questions?,
I'll go where I like,
"For now, I have questions!",
Retrieve the harbormaster’s ledger for me,
Look for it in the eastern sea-tower,
You can find it by following the eastern jetty all the way around to the entrance of the harbor,
"Do that, and I shall consider sparing that fool Iago’s life",
You hand the ledger to the Queen who in turn hands it off to one of her lackeys without even looking,
The man flips through it and offers the queen a short nod,
She waves her hand in an uninterested gesture and a burly pair of gentlemen slink off into the shadows,
One of them is carrying a large ring of keys,
What about it?,
What was I supposed to do again?,
I have the ledger!,
The men standing around roar in laughter and jeers,
Iago bows deeply and backs away,
He grabs you by the arm as you leave,
"You are looking for a captain, yes?",
"Well, you’ll find no better suited ship or crew than the Weathermaiden",
I’ll go ahead and rejoin them in the sea-cave to the north-west of here,
Make your preparations and then seek me out once you are ready,
Together we will bid a fond farewell to this barren rock,
Iago tips his non-existent hat and leaves,
"At some point you may find yourself in search of a ship, no?",
Once my ship is ready to sail again we shall make our way off this barren rock,
Someone throws an overripe fruit,
As he does so he whispers to you “I think it is best we make ourselves scarce,
The natives seem to be getting restless,
You amuse me,
I shall lend my ear,
For now,
About that ledger,
I met Iago,
What is this place?,
How did you end up here?,
The queen’s eyes flash at you and for a moment you feel as if lightning is about to strike,
Then she relaxes back into her self-assured pose,
That man is nothing to me,
He is to rot at my pleasure,
What is his crime?,
The queen cast a brief glance at a young man standing nearby,
His face reddens and a faint smile plays across his lips,
"That is, until he realizes the hot water he’s in and remembers an important task that needs doing somewhere else before scuttling off",
Iago is a worm whose appetite is too big for his own good,
Nothing else,
What is your interest in him?,
He's asked me to put in a good word for him to you,
Has he now?,
"Well, he is clever when that mood strikes him and you’ll certainly find no finer captain in the outer isles",
"For old times sake, I shall offer him this much",
The Harbormaster of Horryn is no doubt food for the crabs,
Or at least for those beasts that roam the streets above,
"However, he kept meticulous journals and ledgers",
Ledgers full of information that reflect poorly on my associates,
"It would be a shame, albeit not unlikely, that these ledgers might have been lost in the calamities that have swept Horryn",
Where should we look for them?,
The Harbormaster kept a storage of his records in the eastern tower that flanks the entrance to the harbor,
"Just follow the eastern jetty, along the sea-wall until you arrive at the tower",
"With the current chaos that reigns above, I’m sure it’s as easy as walking in and walking out again",
"Do this for me, and I’ll consider sparing the life of that wretch of a manling",
I already have them!,
I'll consider it,
I had some more questions first though,
The pair return with Iago dangling comically between them and forcefully deposit him on the stone floor at the queen’s feet,
He slowly and painfully stumbles to his feet while rubbing his sore wrists,
The Blind Maiden has delivered,
"My dear queen, I am ever your",
The Queen’s retort cut’s like a rapier,
"Not another word out of your mouth lest I geld you. {PLAYER}, I thank you for your service but it is time for you to be on your way",
Seeing this scoundrel before me makes my men and me salivate for roasted peacock and I assure you,
That would not be a pretty sight,
"Iago, I don't want you joining me",
You return,
I have some more questions,
About that quest,
A place for free spirits and the free flow of enterprise,
"The Empire would call us thieves, smugglers and brigands but the same Empire would rather starve thousands to death than upset the delicate balance of their taxes and tariffs",
"So instead, we scuttle about like rats in dark places",
We gnaw at the foundations of that swollen corpse,
"But for all our mischief, they cannot help but love us",
They writhe in our muck!,
"In the rare spices, fine oils, exotic magicks and potent poisons that flow into the Heartlands thanks to those like me",
So please,
Cavort in pleasures most carnal while you are here,
No secrets ever leave these halls,
The queen offers a telling smile,
#HorrynSmugglerAlchemistScene,
"A tall, hook-nosed man with eyes like glowing coals and a thick mane of shaggy, black hair is intently staring at a snake wrapped around his forearm as he slowly lowers a small mouse towards its gaping maw",
Ahem,
The man gives a start and both he and the snake hisses annoyed at you,
Insolent!,
Can’t you see I’m busy?!,
"As he talks, he palms the mouse and in a feat of prestidigitation, it seems to disappear",
The snake tastes the air greedily and slithers into the sleeve of his robe and up his arm,
I just came to trade,
Not until you finish your task,
Now be off and do not return until you have a bag of disgusting fungi for me!,
Not so quickly,
The man’s eyes narrow as a menacing smile creeps across his pale face,
"Seeing as you are new here, your value is slightly above nil",
I’ll say this much,
If you wish to peruse my wares you must first perform the smallest of tasks for me,
I require a rare and highly toxic alchemical ingredient that grows in these underhalls,
The caps from the ‘Calivexis’ fungus - Commonly known as ‘vomit cups’,
"Beyond being a prized ingredient for poison-makers, it also stinks like nothing you’ve ever encountered",
That sounds unpleasant,
Oh it is indeed!,
That is part of the reason I’m asking you to do it!,
The other reason is they’ve become more difficult to harvest,
"You see, they grow in caves right outside these very halls",
That’s indeed why I have momentarily taken up residence here,
But,
But the caves connect to domains lorded over by one of these ‘Reaver’ chieftains,
That Oleg fellow,
"To keep things civil, the Queen has sealed off the cave and forbidden anyone to enter it",
She would be most irate if I were to disobey her,
You however are free to feign the fool’s innocence,
How do I get to these caves?,
The entrance to the caves is a barred gate at the end of a long hall of columns,
It lies just west of the Queen’s court,
There is a sentry patrolling the area and you’ll do well to avoid him,
"Once you pass the gate and enter the cave, you’ll find a flooded chamber with exits leading left and right",
Take the left one!,
The right one leads to Olegs domain and I dare say it’s best avoided,
I'll see what I can do,
Run along now!,
I require a small bag of them,
"Indeed, if you are fast and discreet, I’ll even throw in a small bag of gold",
Off you go now!,
Marvelous!,
You’ve proven most useful,
Esteban gingerly places the fungi in an airtight jar and throws you a small purse of gold,
And remember,
Not a word to the queen of rodents about our little agreement,
The snake hisses at you,
I wish to see your wares now,
I'll be on my way then,
The man is apprehensively poking a pile of papers with a stick,
Where’d that little bastard go?,
Let me see your wares!,
I have your vomit cups!,
I have only the finest wares,
#HorrynSmugglerArmandScene,
The fuck do you want?,
Armand’s eyes narrow threateningly as you approach,
What's the fastest way out of the rat maze?,
Afraid of the dark are you?,
Don’t like the rats nipping at your heels?,
Well I suggest you get the fuck back to whereever you came from,
"Go north, east, north, east and then north again",
And don’t come back!,
#HorrynSmugglerArtPeddlerScene,
"Ah, surprised to find a man of such taste in a place like this, are you?",
He chuckles sadly,
I once sold my wares in the Silver Halls of Vauul,
Only the very richest would even be allowed across the threshold of my establishment,
"Alas, for some reason I cannot fathom, the Empire took a dislike to the way I conducted my business, and I had to find a more…discreet location",
The man clears his throat nervously,
"Put simply, the Underhalls are the perfect venue for a man of my caliber to blossom without the prying eyes of tax-collectors and Inquisitors",
"The scenery isn’t exactly ideal, but I am resigned to suffer in silence!",
Mind if I ask some more questions?,
You come across a conspicuously well-dressed man selling what appear to be an odd assortment of precious items and pieces of art,
He looks remarkably out of place amongst the shadows of the Underhalls,
Hail and well met!,
"He proclaims, tipping his hat at you",
Tis plain to me that you are people with a keen understanding of the finer things!,
What say you to peruse some of the finest art in all-the Empire?,
"Even the most superficial of examinations reveals that most of these “art pieces” are barely competent knock-offs and forgeries, a fact that the art dealer seems utterly unashamed by",
His place here makes a lot more sense now,
I might have some questions for you!,
The dealer tips his hat once more,
I would be most delighted to assist!,
What would you like to know?,
Let me see if I have any artifacts for you,
I wish to see your wares!,
What do you do here beyond selling fake art?,
If it isn’t my favorite soon-to-be customers!,
How may I assist you?,
Let's talk a bit,
An athame,
The man whispers as he carefully strokes the blade,
We can only begin to imagine the acts that have been performed with this blade!,
How does 1200 sound?,
Deal!,
No thanks,
Suit yourself,
Do you have anything else?,
I have this!,
Show the Nautical Guild Seal,
How about this?,
Show the idol from the Santa Fury treasure,
Look at this!,
Show the black dagger from under the lighthouse,
Not for now,
Let's talk a bit instead,
Could these be worth something?,
Show the Reaver Tablets,
I’d be more than happy to see any curios you might be carrying!,
The merchant rubs his hands together,
Extraordinary!,
The man’s eyes seem to glitter with an unnatural sheen for a moment,
Now this is the type of item I came here to find,
It’s… uncanny,
He turns it slowly over in his hands,
I must have it! 1500 gold!,
"Ahh, I know this!",
The man eagerly examines the seal,
This is a Captain’s seal from the Nautical Guild,
"They are quite protective of these, you know",
I’ll give you 1000 gold for it!,
The man traces the intricate carvings with his fingertips,
"This is ancient, you know",
Carved in a time before,
"No, it’s best not to think of such things",
What I can tell you is that there are certain collectors who would pay a great deal for these!,
How does 1000 gold sound?,
You have a gut feeling these might still prove useful!,
The dealer lets out a dramatic sigh,
"Alas, some of my wares may be of…questionable origin…but make no mistake, I am no con-artist!",
I am simply a man with a passion for strange and unusual objects!,
And the Outer Isles just so happens to be rife with them!,
"Explorers find them, sell them on to me, and I make sure they reach buyers on the mainland for a… fair price",
Is that legal?,
Let me see if I have anything,
Not exactly,
"But it pays well and keeps my customers happy, so if you find any strange items on your travels, be sure to bring them to me!",
He looks around conspiratorially,
"Discreetly, of course",
#HorrynSmugglerBlacksmithScene,
"Eh, when yer mother squeezes you out in the shit and mud of the back-streets of Adler’s and leaves ya fer dead, yer fucked for choices ...I was lucky enough ta be taken in by the Queen herself",
Saw something in me did she,
Probably wouldn’t be standin’ ere if not for ‘er!,
His gaze goes distant in the way that teen boys sometime do,
You were saying?,
"Anyway, seens as I am ‘ere an all, if ya happen across any weapons ya ain’t partial to on your travels, make sure to drop by, eh?",
I’m sure to have sumthin’ more your style,
You stop before a slightly disheveled young man selling a variety of weapons and armor in a dimly lit corner of the hall,
"‘Ello there, free-sword!",
He flashes you a wasteland of spice-stained teeth in what passes for a smile,
Fancy takin’ a look at some of ma wares?,
"Come back any time, free-sword!",
"An remember, there ain’t no better way of getting respect than what cold steel buys ya!",
I'd like to ask some questions,
"What can I do for ya, free-sword?",
"Welcome back, Free-sword!",
Need something to stick someone with?,
#HorrynSmugglerFoodScene,
She offers you another kind smile,
You may ask whatever you wish!,
Is this really safe to eat?,
Show me your wares!,
Of course it is!,
she replies hastily as you stare at the food with no small amount of dubiousness,
"Everythin’ you see here is the finest, almost-fresh grub the Empire has to offer!",
Almost-fresh?,
She shifts uncomfortably,
"Well, no ones ever lived to complain, if that’s what yer worried about!",
The scent of foreign spices and not-quite-familiar meats assaults your senses as you approach what appears to be a food stall,
"Your interest is noted by a red-faced woman who welcomes you with a wide, genuine smile",
"Fine day for some grub, wouldn’t you say?",
"she grins, gesturing to the array of ‘mysterious’ meats on display",
"I’ve got somethin’ for everyone, from the delectable richness of city-pork to the more comforting subtlety of the finest roof-chicken!",
And people actually eat this?,
Like ravenous rats!,
"Trick is, if you season it just right, it all tastes like chicken anyways",
So they keep filling my purse and I keep filling their bellies,
"Hmm, if you say so",
Welcome back!,
Need somethin’ to fill yer belly for the road ahead?,
#HorrynSmugglerSentrySpotted,
Hey!,
You’re not welcome in this part of the underhalls!,
Queen’s orders,
Get out of here and don’t let me catch you here again!,
The guard firmly escorts you out of the area and deposits you in the guard-room by the entrance,
#HorrynSmugglerTrinketsScene,
The stall before you is crammed full of various trinkets and knick-knacks precariously balanced atop of one another,
"As you approach, a wiry young man with a horribly pock-marked face offers you an excited grin",
"On the hunt for some treasure, my fellow-adventurer?",
Then you’ve come to the right place!,
Everythin’ you see here has been carefully collected by yours truly!,
he gestures to the stall,
You wouldn’t believe the stuff just left layin’ around out there!,
"Only the other day, I found a one-of-a-kind-necklace just discarded in the mud….it was next to a corpse, mind, but it was in no condition to argue if ya know what I mean!",
It is clear from the merchant’s ramblings that his way of securing his wares isn’t exactly legal,
But what down here is?,
You suppose it won't hurt to find out more,
"Ah, the life of an adventurer is a dangerous one, but it’s worth it for loot like this!",
He gestures enthusiastically to his stall,
I’ve braved some of the most disgusting sewers and dug through the trash of some of the finest men in the Empire in order to obtain such coveted wares!,
That sounds...interesting,
"Sadly, I can’t always be out explorin’...especially not during the day",
he coughs awkwardly,
"So if you’ve got any treasures of your own you’d be happy partin’ with, make sure to pay me a visit!",
The young rogue excitedly licks his lips,
"Want to know more about my treasures, do you?",
I’d be happy to tell you anything you want to know!,
Where did you come across these 'treasures'?,
Let's see what you have!,
The young rascal is picking intently at a bloody scab when he excitedly notices you,
"Welcome back, fellow-adventurer!",
Found worthwhile loot?,
#RatQueensArmor,
An exquisitely crafted set of armor that no doubt belongs to the queen of the underhalls,
Kat’s eyes seem to sparkle as she admires it,
Take the armor,
You carefully remove the beautiful set of armor from the stand and stash it in your backpack,
#UnderhallsFungusCluster,
A cluster of giant 'vomit cup' fungi grow in these cave,
They emit an odor so foul you would only touch them if you were paid to do so,
Carefully gather some of the caps for Esteban,
You slice off a few of the larger caps and place them in a bag,
The stench is almost overwhelming,
The stench is overwhelming and leaves you stricken with nausea,

# Chapter_1_HorrynWalls,
#,
#EnteringHorryn,
"The gates stand conspicuously open, and you step carefully through into the ghost-town",
"As if in greeting, a swarm of vermin pours out of every doorway and crevice towards you, covering the street in a mangy, skittering carpet",
"You set your feet, ready to meet the living tide - but the rats part, scurrying past you and out beyond the gates",
Sewer rats,
So why are they all above ground?,
And in such a hurry,
Roland asks as he stomps on a stray rodent,
Driina wades unperturbed into the tide of vermin,
Our path leads through this sea of filth!,
Onwards!,
"From the stink of them, you guess they're sewer rats",
You wonder what could have driven them above ground in such numbers,
#HorrynFishermanGates,
"For the refugees in the camp, hunger and disease is the greatest danger for now",
"Until we find a way to enter the city, we must do what we can to deal with the problems at hand",
Finding food and medicine,
I say we return to the camp and offer our help Marcus the chamberlain,
He's holed up in the stable,
People are dying inside as we stand here,
I swore an oath to fight for those who cannot and every second we waste here I desecrate that oath,
There are people dying outside these walls as well,
What do we suggest we do?,
"A large, worn steel gate bars this entrance",
You shake it and find it securely locked with no visible way of forcing it open,
"Looking around, you take in the battlements of the walled city",
"For a city this size, they are impressive",
As if reading your mind Roland offers laconically,
These walls were built to keep people out,
They seem to be doing a good job,
It may prove more difficult than you originally thought to find a way into the city,
"Though you feel certain that clues to Embla’s fate lie inside the beleaguered city, it seems that for now, fate has conspired to place an insurmountable obstacle in your way",
"Until a solution presents itself, you must look elsewhere for purpose and surely there are many on this accursed island whose life will depend on your resolve",
Driina lets out an uncharacteristic scream of rage as she kicks the door heavily before slumping down against the wall,
"As in response to her anger, somewhere deep inside the beleaguered city a manic laughter cackles briefly",
Are you okay?,
What do we do now?,
Driina looks up and casts a sorrowful gaze out across the ocean,
Foaming surfs beat the shore and gulls cry greedily overhead,
She sniffles and wipes her eyes as her face stiffens into a resolute mask,
You’re right,
The poor wretches huddling in the camp are hardly better off,
"For now, we need to do what we can for them",
What do you suggest we do?,
#HorrynGates,
The gates to Horryn loom before you,
"The massive portcullis is down, however, and there's no way to open it from this side",
"On the other side, you see the dead, piled atop one another, up against the portcullis",
"They must have died trying to escape the town, caught between the gates and whatever assailants were in the town with them",
Driina's face is ashen,
I knew these people,
I delivered their children and cared for their dead,
To see them like this,
I will have vengeance,
She sets her jaw,
There is another way,
The Fisherman's Gate,
"We follow the walls east, and then south",
"The town beyond the gate seems entirely still, and empty",
But you doubt you've seen an end to the horrors within,
"In any case, you must find another way in",
#HorrynHogs,
The small farmhouse seems desolate and abandoned,
"The only sign of life is a pack of grotesquely swollen hogs, feeding greedily on something deep in the mud",
"When you catch a glimpse through a brief break in the frenzy, you realize it's the corpses of what must have been their former owners",
Infernal swine,
Driina spits behind you,
These hogs look like more than a handfull,
Best be careful lest we all end up with a tusk in the gut,
Roland grumbles,
"The grotesquely hulking swine look like they'd happily make you their next meal, if you were to disturb them",
Carry on,
#HorrynSpiral1,
#HorrynSurvivor,
That's what the Reavers call 'im,
"Far as I know, he became the head of the Fishermen's Lodge",
Must be the one who turned 'em to reavin',
But I aint never seen 'im afore and I've been in Horryn my whole life,
He must be an outsider,
I had another question,
We must be on our way!,
"When the Reavers went amok, they butchered folks in the street where they found them",
But that was only in the beginning,
"Once they had control of the city, they started dragging people from their houses, roundin' 'em up",
Only the eldest and youngest were... finished off first,
I can't get my head around it,
One of the Reavers made 'em let me go,
"Tore me from her grasp, and told me to run to the camp north of town to tell the folks there that their loved-ones would be waitin' for 'em at the keep with",
Father,
"If we don't get her back before they reach the keep, she'll be dead or worse on the morrow",
I need some information first,
A gaunt figure shambles out of the fog towards you,
The man is emaciated and covered in filth,
He looks with exhausted eyes and stops dead in his tracks as he notices you,
His eyes wide in terror but his body too frail to flee,
"Please, don't kill me!",
"the withered looking man cries out, as he cowers before you",
I'm Philip!,
Just a fisherman,
"Please, help me, my wife is still trapped inside the city, and... and",
And what?,
What is going inside the walls?,
"I beg of you, find Natia",
She's all I got since our boy passed!,
"And she yet lives... you'll know by her green dress and long, auburn hair",
"If there are survivors left inside Horryn, it is my duty to save them",
"Driina says, as you turn to go",
Survivors or not - this stinks of a trap,
Roland interjects,
"As if to echo the man's woe, a lone wail rings out from somewhere behind the city walls",
The Fishermen's Lodge!,
Some of my fellows joined - to share in the catch and ensure none went hungry!,
"I thought about joining myself, as their nets seemed overflowing as of late",
"Since Father took charge, I been told",
But how can the Lodge go from sharing fish to reaving their own kin?,
The man frets uncomfortably,
Reavers?,
Father?,
The keep?,
Lodges?,
I need to move on!,
How can men reach such cruel lows?,
"I known some of 'em for years, good, honest fishermen - now they've gone mad!",
It's this 'Father' I tell you!,
Him and his outsiders brought this upon us and poisoned the lodges!,
Now they hold the whole bloody city!,
"That is, it’s bloody bedlam in there!",
"Seems to me a few of them, the meanest and hardest are the ones who answer directly to the Father",
They’re the ones who took Natia and they seem to be holed up in the keep,
Only going outside to get more bodies!,
The man shudders,
The ones that still roam the streets ‘ave all lost their minds it seems!,
"All of a sudden they started fighting each other and for a while, it seemed they were more concerned with killing each other instead of razing the city!",
Now they’re all holed up in each their corner of the city it seems,
Did you find Natia!?,
What news inside the walls?!,
"Philip asks, trembling",
Have you found Natia yet?,
Please!,
I fear it might be too late already!,
I have some questions first,
"Those that are taken were dragged to the keep, and all the remains of 'em are screams... such screams",
My wife an' I hid fer days with no food or water,
"By this morning, we couldn't take it no more and made a run for it",
They got us before we even got within sight of the gate,
"They beat us like mangy dogs, even my Natia... told us Father was waiting for us",
"Bloody, forsaken bastards - they'll be dragging her away as we speak!",
"By the dead, you have to save her for me!",
She's beautiful!,
She’s got long auburn hair!,
But you got away?,
The Governors keep!,
Lies in the south-western part of town,
You enter it from the docks,
But they have it all sealed up now!,
Ain’t no way yer getting in there now!,
That’s why you have to get to my Natia before they take her there!,
"Please, we’ve wasted too much time already!",

#Chapter1IdraLandingLuggage,
Better yet,
"The combination lock remains sound, meaning the content of the chest is likely still unmolested",
"You best not be getting any ideas with my property, little fishy",
Basilo growls as he eyes you suspiciously,
I think you mean MY property?,
Wha.. wha… what’cha mean?,
"That just ‘cause she made you live, now you’re somehow entitled to Basilo’s treasures?",
Basilo’s the Mother’s chosen!,
Not you!,
Now fuck off and get me that teliscope if you want yer bleeding box!,
I choose violence you old fool!,
Basilo looks surprised and stutters incoherently,
The man’s eyes tear up,
There’s truth in that!,
Basilo knows it in his bones!,
Pox on you: there’s truth in it!,
Have yer bleeding box,
Basilo goes off to sulk in a corner,
Open the chest,
The chest ahead of you is wet and covered in seaweed,
It also looks familiar,
"Instantly, you realize this is your luggage from the Zephyr",
"It had been stowed too well to get to during the mutiny but by some miracle, it made it to shore where it must have been “salvaged",
"What old Mother Maelstrom saw fit to bequeath upon me, I’s keeps",
Basilo’s eyes narrow as he fiddles the strap of his club,
"Then again, that’s not to say I mightn’t be willing to make a deal with ya?",
What did you have in mind?,
"See there’s this man, a stargazer he is, came here a few days ago",
Perched hisself on that cliff right over there,
Basilo points to the cliff that rises over the beach to the east,
"Thing is, he was carrying something I can hardly put into words",
Is like a tube with glass in it that you use to look at the stars and such!,
A telescope?,
That’s what he called it!,
Old Basilo would love to have it if you can get your way up to where he made camp!,
There’s meaning in the stars you see - Old wisdom and such,
And don’t fret!,
Basilo saw big ol’ fat crows circling near the camp,
I’ll bet Basilo’s eye that the Stargazer’s dead and rotting and his teliscope’s just waiting to be salvaged!,
I’d rather you just hand my things over,
Mother Maelstrom’s favored and all,
As you hand the telescope over to the wreck-picker his eyes light up in a not wholly sane manner,
Chest’s yours little fish!,
Basilo shouts over his shoulder as he rushes out into the yard with his new prize,
If you be nosing around Basilo’s treasures you best have something for me!?,
Basilo barks at you,
I have the telescope,
#Chapter1Landing,
The Shores of Idra,
"Slowly, you drag yourself from the cold water onto the relative safety of solid rock",
"You try, and fail, to stagger forwards as exhaustion washes over you in a great, black wave",
Oblivion takes you before you hit the rocky ground,
.......,
You're awoken by the cacophonous cries of gulls circling you,
Your body is a mass of pain and exhaustion - covered in a thousand cuts and scrapes,
The large white birds gather around you in eager anticipation,
What a magnificent feast your bloated corpse would make,
Not today,
Minutes or perhaps hours pass as you lay unmoving - trying desperately to will some warmth back into your body,
Finally you manage to force your eyes open,
"By some miracle you are not only alive, but you find yourself on the shores of the cursed island of Idra",
Strewn around you is the wreckage of the Zephyr,
You see no other survivors,
"Lest you find equipment and companions soon, you may have cheated death in vain",
#Chapter1LandingCrabCave,
"Large, mis-shapen crabs emerge from the water all around you!",
"Intentionally or not, the seemingly mindless beasts have lain an ambush for you!",
Fight,
They took the bodies of the drowned!,
Men and women I’ve known for years!,
All blue and swollen,
Dragged them into this cave,
Crabs as big as horses!,
How can such a thing be?,
What’s wrong with this place?,
It occurs to you that the wretch either does not recognize you from the Zephyr or he is too desperate to care,
"In any case, I was too weak to fight back when I landed and they must have thought I was dead",
Dragged me into the darkness,
"But when I heard those sounds, claws rending dead flesh, something awoke in me!",
I kicked and screamed as best I could and they let me go!,
I ran as fast as I could but I took a turn in the darkness and ended up here!,
I could hear them moving about in the caves around me and I didn’t dare try to make it out,
If you hadn’t come here I’d have died from thirst!,
The way out should be clear for you now!,
A Foul Cave,
Eons worth of the sea’s ravage upon the land has given birth to this cave,
"From its depths, a stench of seaweed and rotting flesh rises",
"So foul is it, that it feels like some evil entity attempting to force its way through the pores of your skin, into the core of your being",
Try to not vomit,
"Your breathing becomes rapid and shallow as your mind is flooded by the image of foul things in the darkness, feasting on the spilling entrails of swollen sea-corpses",
The chamber around you spins and you vomit explosively,
"Feeling utterly empty, you regain your composure after a few minutes",
The narrow passages of the cave ahead seem foreboding,
"Steeling your resolve, you manage to calm your breathing",
"Though the stench persists, you manage to push the image of foul things in the darkness, feasting on the spilling entrails of swollen sea-corpses, from your mind",
You carry on into the darkness,
The corpses of the doomed crew of the Zephyr are arranged around the chambers central column,
"A pale light shines down from an aperture in the vaulted cave ceiling above, illuminating their bloated features and pale blue skin",
Is there a form of artistry to their arrangement?,
For a brief moment you almost find it… beautiful?,
The thought comes into your mind unbidden,
An interloper,
"Stepping between the corpses, you spot a man who you immediately recognize as the Zephyr’s first mate",
"Around his neck, a sturdy chain glimmers and you carefully fish out a strange octagonal amulet, richly filigreed and with the navigational roset of the Nautical Guild carved on it",
This is no doubt the Captain’s Seal and is apparently an item that the guild will pay handsomely to have returned to them,
"As you pocket the amulet, you become aware of movement in the waters around you",
Strange stalked eyes regard you as several of the chitinous horrors emerge,
"No doubt, the abominations have come to feed on the flesh of the dead",
Or the living,
Attempt to sneak away,
Attack the beasts,
The abominable creatures snap their claws greedily as they advance towards you!,
No doubt intending to make you part of their gruesome display!,
You carefully step away from corpse and begin to try and make your way out of the horrid chamber,
"Curse me, I have to get out of this hole!",
I don’t even know how long I’ve been in here?,
It’s like time doesn’t pass right but I’ve not died from thirst yet so it can’t be that long!,
I just need to get out!,
Explain the way to the exit,
Hold on,
A strangely haunting piping can be heard from the caves ahead,
Surely it must be the wind?,
"Then again, it rises and falls with an eerie sense of musicality that does nothing to set your mind at ease",
Forge ahead,
"You had nearly grown accustomed to the foul stench that lingers in these caves, but now it once more assaults your senses with renewed vigor!",
Rolling out of the eastern passage like so many black tendrils probing for a way into the very core of your being,
Whatever lies ahead must be at the center of the rot that permeates this pit,
Forge ahead!,
You vomit violently and the sounds of your retching echoes through the chamber around you,
"With each spasm, your gasping draws in another lung-full of the tainted air until you feel permeated by the foulness",
Where do you end and the filth begin?,
"Through grit alone, you refuse to let the foulness find purchase and you fight down the nausea that wells up inside you",
A Survivor,
Who... who goes there?,
A haggard man dressed in the livery of the Nautical Guild huddles apprehensively in the corner of the small chamber you’re standing in,
His lips are dry and cracked and he appears to be parched,
Please tell me you’ve found a way out of this pit!,
I have!,
What are you doing here?,
The desperate man wastes no time scrambling past you and towards fresh air and relative safety,
That was Ari!,
Kat seems flustered,
Poor bastard,
Sounds like he’s losing his mind the way he was talking!,
Trapped down here for days?,
He’s an arse but he didn’t deserve that,
None of them did,
Andry,
Thanks for finding a way out of that bloody cave!,
"If them crabs hadn't gotten me, the thirst would have",
Can you imagine?,
Slowly going insane in the darkness,
All alone and dying?,
Thank you so much!,
I'll live to see another day!,
By the Golden Dead I’ll be mending my wicked ways if I make it out of here!,
No more dice and whoring!,
#Chapter1LandingFarm,
Derelict Farm,
The small farm is overgrown and derelict and it appears to be abandoned,
"At one point, you muse, this must have been a quaint place",
A good spot to raise a family perhaps?,
"Suddenly, as if summoned by your very thoughts, the faint but unmistakable sound of children’s laughter is carried on the wind",
The sound is oddly distorted with a strange echoing quality and for some reason it chills you to your bones,
"The sound is interrupted by a woman’s cry of pain, or perhaps sorrow",
#Chapter1LandingKat,
Are you sure?,
I would have thought it safer to not go alone,
"On second thought, let's travel together",
"Yes, I'm sure",
I would have thought it wiser to stick together but I’ll not twist your arm,
I’ll see if I can’t find that farm north of here,
You’ll find me there,
Stay safe!,
Kat nimbly makes her way along the rocky shoreline and into the fog,
Wading out of the freezing surf you lose your footing on the slick stones and fall heavily to the ground,
There is a sudden blur of movement in the corner of your eye and as you frantically try to get to your feet you slip again,
Standing above you on a large rock is a young woman dressed in Nautical Guild livery,
"Wet, auburn hair clings to her face in the cold wind",
"So I would say, that cave to the west is where we should start looking",
You ready to go?,
Let's go!,
I prefer to travel alone,
I have some questions first!,
Magi’s balls!,
I was sure I was the only one to make it ashore,
The woman leaps from the rocks and helps you back on your feet,
"Looking you up and down, she fetches a wineskin from her belt and offers it to you",
The skin is nearly empty save for a last mouthful of brandy,
You drink it down greedily and slowly you feel a modicum of warmth creep into your bones,
You recognize the young woman’s face now,
She must have served on the Zephyr,
She has an arrow cocked on a shortbow and as you squint up at her she draws the string back,
Give me one good reason not to end you right now!,
You recognize the young woman’s face,
Mercy!,
It was nothing personal,
The girl scoffs at you,
You’re just like the rest of them,
Step on any neck so long as it gets you a leg up,
That it?,
She’s red faced with anger,
I was when they sold me to the Nautical Guild,
Did you know I’m listed in their records as an asset?,
A bleeding commodity to use and trade away as they will!,
How many nights have I spent dreaming of that bloody ship sinking so I could get away,
But now that it’s happened,
You were a slave?,
Who sold you?,
Shut your bleeding mouth before I put an arrow through your neck!,
She draws the string back even further and for a long moment you think she’s going to let loose,
Instead she sighs deeply and lowers her bow,
"One way or another, you did buy me my freedom and I’d be a cursed woman for putting you down as thanks",
Even if I’m stuck here on this bloody island for now,
"I’ll tell you what, help me get away from here and I’ll consider us even?",
You can start by telling me your name,
Katyana’s my name,
The crew calls me Kat,
Or rather they did I suppose,
She looks up and down the beach with a furrowed brow,
"Listen, you have to get up",
We need to get off this beach before you freeze,
Or worse,
Worse?,
Captain’s seal,
It’s a medallion of sorts that is carried on every guild vessel,
It’s not just for show either,
They say the seals are forged by the Magi and that they have secret powers but I don’t know nothing about that,
All I know is the guild pays well to have one returned if a ship is ever lost,
"It's always worn by one of the officers, but I don't think the Captain had it on him when the fight broke out",
Might have been the First Mate was carrying it and I think he was still alive when the ship sank,
We need supplies and shelter first,
There might be salvage to be had among the wreckage on the beach,
I also think I spotted the chimney of a house just north of the cliffs,
A warm fire and some food would go a long way,
Kat offers you her hand and drags you to your feet,
She looks pensively towards the west,
"Also, as I said there’s a cave west of here",
I think the crabs dragged off most of the corpses there but what if,
What if they’re not all dead?,
Might be other survivors like you and me,
"What's more, there's a chance one of the officers was carrying the seal when the boat sank",
"If we can find it, the Nautical Guild would give anything to have it returned to them",
Seal?,
There’s something wrong about this place,
Can’t you feel it?,
Like a taste in your mouth,
And there are beasts,
Huge sea creatures I ain’t never seen afore,
I saw them dragging the dead crew-men into a cave west of here,
At least I hope they were dead,
Kat shudders,
What do you suggest?,
Good,
I found this bow in a cargo crate,
We best find you a weapon too as soon as possible,
I suspect we’ll need it before long,
"Together you begin to move, off the beach and towards whatever darkness dwells in the island’s interior",
There’ll be plenty more time for that once we get off the beach,
Are you ready?,
You're not coming with me,
You’re back?,
I see the beasts that roam the shoreline didn’t get the better of you!,
Let's travel together!,
I’ll go with you,
Let’s gather what weapons and equipment we can and make for the inland,
#Chapter1LandingMarita,
"Kneeling in the grass, you notice a satchel lying where Martita was kneeling",
You get a feeling it was left there for you,
"Slowly, you regain your composure and get to your feet",
"Shambling away from the well, you suddenly stiffen",
Did you just hear something?,
A child's voice perhaps?,
Or was just the wind?,
The woman rocks slowly back and forth as she stares blankly at the well in front of her,
What has happened?,
It took them,
Called out to them,
I heard it,
Funny thing is,
I heard it calling with my voice,
Oleg and Anja live in the well now,
They’re calling for me to join them,
Can I help?,
It will never stop,
It will multiply until it covers all the lands and all the seas,
"And when we are all dead and bones, the conqueror mold will dress our corpses in black mourning veils",
Her voice is flat and monotone and the strange words almost seem to come from somewhere else,
She then lets out a deep sigh,
"But if I had my children’s bones to bury, it would give me some respite",
"A moment of silence, then the sickening sound of children’s laughter once again rises from the well",
"The skeletal figure of Marita sits in front of the well, rocking silently back and forth",
I have your children's bones,
Marita looks up at you and blinks as if waking from a dream,
"Without a word, she gingerly takes the small bundle of bones in her arms as if it was a swaddled infant",
She cradles it for a moment and then looks up at you with grateful eyes,
She gently strokes your cheek once and then turns and wanders into the fog,
You’ve set her free,
"Falling to your knees, you retch violently",
If it is from the conqueror mold or the emotional moment you can’t quite tell,
#Chapter1LandingTelescope,
You steel yourself and gaze back into the cosmic aberration,
"A moment stretches into hours, days, eons",
Stars are birthed and die; collapsing in on themselves in cataclysms that shake the very foundations of creation,
Open your mind,
"As you come to, you are sitting befuddled in the grass near the telescope",
You have no idea of how much time has passed but you feel like you have traveled impossible distances,
"For a fleeting moment, you sense profound realizations as they flee your mind like dreams upon waking",
"With a ringing head and a deep feeling of dread creeping in, you vow never to gaze into that accursed telescope again",
"Dread fills you as you realize that in the far recesses of your mind, thoughts are now lurking that originated elsewhere",
"Unbidden and utterly alien, their greeting is a droning echo",
The eyes of the Dragon are opening,
You vow to never peer through that accursed telescope again,
A finely wrought telescope used for astronomical observations,
Its lenses are no doubt the product of some of the Empire’s finest Hyalomancers and allows stars to be observed even in full daylight,
Examine the seas,
Examine the sky in general,
Examine the southeastern quadrant of the sky,
Take telescope,
You cannot bring yourself to look in that accursed telescope again,
"You look out upon the churning, gray roil that surrounds the windswept shores of Idra",
"Far out there, among the great waves and beating winds you swear you momentarily see a great glistening shape shifting just beneath the surface",
Whatever madness has befallen this island you are certainly safer here than on any ship out there,
Use the telescope further,
"You point the telescope skywards, and after a few moments of searching, you find a gap where the stormy skies have parted just enough to allow you to examine the stars in their firmament",
Examine it more closely,
A moment of confusion washes over you as you find yourself utterly disoriented in a sky you should know as well as the back of your hand,
The poor astronomer was right,
Somehow the stars you see in the sky are utterly alien to you,
The realization leaves you chilled to your bones,
Instinctively you look away from the strange stellar vista,
Look back at the sky,
Use the telescope for something else,
"Though you realize your knowledge of astronomy is quite lacking, you are nonetheless left with a feeling of wrongness that you can’t quite explain",
Training the telescope on the southeastern quadrant of the sky your eyes are immediately drawn to what appears to be something akin to a small reddish cluster of stars,
"Though, at first the tiny speck is hardly noticeable, it seems to grow larger as you regard it",
"At once you're struck with the terrible realization that as you are watching it, it is gazing back",
Tear your eyes away,
Hold the gaze,
"As you feel tendrils of something utterly alien grasping at your consciousness, you tear yourself away from the telescope in panic",
You turn away from the accursed apparatus and decide to never again use it,
#Chapter1LandingWell,
"One by one, you pry loose the bones from the writhing of the ganglion",
Its motions become more and more agitated as you work and a wave of relief washes over you as the last piece comes loose,
Now you must make your way out of this death-trap,
Mold,
"As you descend deeper into the earthy cave, you realize that the black mold covers most of the walls",
Even the air is thick with floating black specks,
"Here and there, the mold seems to form nodules",
"Your mind fills with images of the nodules bursting open in an obscene mockery of birth and black, worm-like tendrils of mold spilling forth into the world",
An irrational urge to touch the nodes begin to grow inside you,
Move on,
Touch nodes,
"Perhaps it’s the thickness of the air, or the sickly miasmas that fill this part of the cave, but stars flash before your eyes",
Your mind is assaulted with images of alien landscapes,
Cities?,
"No, giant living structures, almost like the coral that the traders from the Sea-Gates sometimes peddle",
But large,
So large it almost touches the sky,
Then you see it,
The structures themselves writhe with obscene life,
Innumerable black worm-like tendrils of black mold cover them,
They beckon you,
Give in to them,
Let them take hold,
In the sky above you something massive shifts,
Carry on!,
Give In,
The Sanctum,
You feel as if you’re dragged under and into the crushing blackness to unfathomable depths,
Stars flash before your eyes again and you once more see the impossible landscapes,
Cyclopean edifices of writhing black shapes,
An age of worms,
You understand now,
This is not some alien dream-scape,
This is Warda,
This is home,
And you?,
You are a high-priest!,
The god-regent of a perfect world!,
And now it is time!,
The sky sunders!,
SEVEN EYES SEE!,
IT COMES!,
GIVE YOURSELF TO IT!,
"Gathering all your willpower, you wrest back control of your faculties and forge ahead",
On the wall ahead you spot it,
A festering ganglion of black ichor with two small human skulls leering from it,
The Children,
The two diminutive shapes materialize as if from the very walls themselves,
"Bodies alive with writhing mold, their blank, idiotic faces stare up at you in a grotesque imitation of life",
Your blood runs cold as organs that should never shape human voices spill forth the sound of children laughing,
"A loud shriek escapes from the horrors and in a maelstrom of writhing blackness, the two pathetic creatures, reshape into lean forms that tower over you",
They do not intend to let you leave,
Try to dash past them and escape,
Abominations!,
You attempt to slip past the monstrosities but they have you boxed in,
The only way out is now through them,
Stand your ground,
"Feigning left and dashing right, you manage to slip past the mindless creatures and before they manage to regain their bearings, you have clambered up the ropes and escaped the well",
"As you flop over the rim of the well and onto the ground, a faint “Mother!",
escapes from below,
The Ganglion,
The mass of glistening mold pulsates with a grotesque peristaltic motion as you approach it,
Embedded in it is a collection of small animal bones,
"Nonetheless, you have no problems identifying two complete, small human skeletons",
Grab the bones,
Oblivion,
"You dig your fingers into the black, substance and breathe deeply in tainted air, welcoming the pulsating presence that surrounds you to invade your flesh",
It does not hesitate and the warmness of unity fills your very being as new life beings,
Stars align and the Dragon stirs in the void,
Haruma,
HARUMA!,
Become one,
A Well,
The well seems ordinary enough until you examine it more closely,
A thin layer of slimy black mold seems to cling to its walls and a heavy odor of filth rises from its depths,
You could swear you heard something splash around in the shallow waters,
A ladder has been placed in the well-shaft and you could easily descend if you wanted to,
Descend,
A woman sits in the grass ahead of you with the well looming over her,
"She is emaciated, ragged and covered in grime",
How long has she been sitting here?,
Weeks?,
She rocks back and forth,
Almost catatonic,
"Then, suddenly you hear it again",
The clear sound of playful children’s laughter rises from the well,
The woman wails,
#Chapter1LeavingLanding,
"Emerging from the rocky shores, you survey the dreary interiors of Idra",
"Rolling hills and moors cover much of the surrounding areas and tall, jagged mountains rise towards the north",
"East of you, a lighthouse can be seen; Its faint light flickering against the gloom",
Beyond that lies a bay and from its far shore the wind carries the foul stench of burning corpses,
"Something is deeply wrong on this island and though you have survived this far, you are still poorly equipped and alone",
"Nevertheless, you’re here for a reason and according to lord Cato, Embla’s last known location was the township of Horryn",
"Whilst your road leads to Horryn eventually, you must also explore your surroundings well",
You need to re-equip and find allies if you are to survive,
"As you set out across the blasted landscape, you have a growing feeling that whatever horrific fate has befallen this region it's somehow inexorably tied to your quest",
"Something dark and vast is slowly spreading throughout the Outer Isles, tentacles grasping greedily as if searching for something",
Great adventures may lie ahead but so does great terror,
Of that you are absolutely certain,
There’s something wrong here on this island,
Something really bad,
Kat suppresses a shiver,
You came here for a reason right?,
With mercenaries and all,
Had to have been something important?,
I was hired to find somebody,
Kat listens intently as you tell her about your quest to find Embla Berryn,
Girl’s lucky to have family care for her,
Kat mumbles,
So the old man told you she was last seen in Horryn right?,
"Well, I’ve been to Horryn",
Landed there on our last run,
"I could tell something felt off about the place, but nothing like this",
"Here’s how I see it, Horryn isn’t far - Just a day’s march to the east around the bay",
"However, I think we need to be all clever-like about this",
Make sure we re-arm and maybe even try to pick up a few allies,
If we rush in and end up dead we’re not doing this Embla any good’s what I’m trying to say,
"So, we should explore around a bit right?",
Gather a bit o’ intelligence and what-not,
We need to take it step by step,
I'd prefer it if you leave the strategy to me,
Yeah just like that,
Kat nods,
See over there?,
"Kat points towards the lighthouse to the east,",
Lighthouse’s still lit so it’s bound to be manned,
If we make our way there we might find out more about what’s going on,
Might even scrounge up a hot meal,
Let's get a move on,
Any other suggestions?,
"Alright, alright!",
I didn’t mean to overstep,
Just don’t get us killed is what I’m saying,
Kat looks at her feet,
"So, where to then?",
I'll work something out,
"Kat looks around, squinting against the wind",
She nod’s her head towards the northern shore,
"I suppose any other survivors and wreckage from the Zephyr would be washed up on shore north-west of where we landed, right?",
Might be worth a look-see?,
Let's head out then!,
#Chapter1SealFollowUp,
"Snapping out of it, you force your mind back to the issue at hand",
"For now, there is little to be done about the amulet and you best be on your way",
No doubt the information stored inside this device is its true value to the Nautical Guild,
The Zephyr was sunk by some unknown horror and the Guild would pay dearly to learn more about such a dire threat to its operations,
"Then again, you did play some role in the ship's demise as well and that information might also be gleaned from the device",
Carefully examining the device you discover it has a complex mechanical inner working,
"In part, that mechanism seems to allow the user to perform complicated navigational calculations",
"But more so, the device seems to have a core of mnemonic runes",
Perhaps it serves as a form of captain’s log?,
This artifact is not mundane and you’re inclined to agree with Kat that it might be worth something to the Nautical Guild,
Or someone else,
"Beyond that, the strange amulet is beyond your ken",
Stepping into the fresh air you pull the strange octagonal Guild Seal from your pocket and examine it more closely,
The dark metallic surface is covered in intricately carved lines and symbols,
It reminds you of a mix between a compass and an astrolabe,
Try to think if you've heard about something like this before,
Try to examine its inner workings,
You feel the weight of the strange device in your hands,
For a moment you're back on the deck of the Zephyr,
Monstrous tentacles rise above the ship like strange alien towers,
Terrified screams fill the air,
You shudder,
Kat’s voice snaps you out of it,
"If we ever get off this bloody island and back to the mainland, the Guild will pay well to have that returned",
All I ask is you remember who told you about it,
Don't worry,
We'll split the coin,
You can keep the coin,
All I want is to be done with the Guild,
Be free to wander as I like,
Maybe wander up to my brother and stick a knife in his fat gut,
Your brother?,
Twas my older brother who sold me off to the Guild,
I was bloody twelve!,
Twenty years is what I owe them on account of that bastard,
I’ve already wasted 10 years,
Her voice breaks for a moment before steel creeps back into her otherwise soft features,
Like I said; gutting the bastard will go a long way towards setting things right,
And the amulet will help you somehow?,
"Sure, I’m free enough for now, but the Guild doesn’t like to let their assets go and they have a way of catching up with those who jump ship",
Even someone as lowly as me,
Dangling a recovered captain’s seal in front of them is exactly the kind of thing that might sway them,
We'll do what we can!,
I’m liking you more and more,
Let’s start by getting off this bloody island alive!,
Kat’s eyes narrow slightly as if she tries to get a read on you,
Let’s just get moving,
We might have our work cut out just getting off this bloody island,
You have indeed heard about this type of device before,
"As you understand it, it allows the officers of a Nautical Guild ship to operate the vessel’s complicated navigational instruments",
"But more than that, it also serves as a device that records the captain’s log",
#Chapter1WreckPicker,
"The man looks at you, eyes wide in genuine surprise and shock",
Then a mask of pure rage falls across his face,
You shouldn't be all healthy and like!,
Mother Maelstrom offered you up for me!,
Basilo will make you stop squirming little fish!,
Marita's little runts,
Oleg and Anja I think,
Spends most of their time playing with their mother in the well,
Oh no,
Don't worry!,
Little ones are right as rain!,
Sometimes I even hear them laughing and singing rhymes all night down in the well!,
Crabs and critters and such,
Growing large and... strange this time of year,
Get your leg in their clippers and they'll lob it right off,
So you best be careful!,
But not to worry,
Basilo's always given them the laugh - even when he was wee,
Must'a been just as big back then,
Though it doesn't really feel that way,
The old man's brows furrow and for a moment he is lost in deep thought,
In any case,
The old man reaches into the leather pouch and pulls out a handful of strange coins that look nothing like standard Imperial coinage,
"Though they are no doubt valuable, they’re covered in greenish grime that make them almost look more like sea-shells than coins",
Bounty from the deep!,
Handed down from me da’ who got it from me granda’,
He used to say granda’ was so strong in the old faith that Mother Maelstrom would let him go down into the deep and visit with them who live there,
Came back with sacks of this he did,
Nice a place as ever you'll see!,
"Warm fire, roof over your head",
Marita’s good to old Basilo letting him stay here,
Take care of her in return Basilo does,
She spends all her time playing in the yard with her kids these days and she forgets to eat,
Some days I have to feed her to make sure she don’t waste away,
The old man smiles warmly,
There are children here?,
"The fireplace casts a warm glow across the piles of old fishbones, broken furniture and strange trinkets that litter the ruined home",
Basilo hums contently to himself,
Let's trade,
Where did you get all that coin?,
What's wrong with the well?,
What happened to this place?,
I've choosen to end you!,
The Wreck Picker,
A lanky man with skin like sun-dried leather stares slack-jawed at you,
He’s dressed in rags and with a wide brimmed hat and a large bundle of scrap slung over his shoulder,
Do Basilo’s eyes deceive him?,
More ghosts?,
Or did the sea spit you back out alive?,
Not many are that lucky!,
Your eyes fall on the crude spiked club that hangs in his belt,
Basilo makes his living picking at what the mother of maelstroms does not swallow,
And it’s been rich pickings as of late,
Crates and barrels and even the odd fleshy morsel!,
The man bares a row of blackened teeth in what you assume is a smile,
Rich pickings?,
What's the club for?,
Listen here; Basilo has a proposal for you!,
The man smiles in greedy anticipation,
Shore’s bursting with bounty today!,
Man can make a fortune if he sets his mind to it,
Basilo will be warming his bones up at the old abandoned farm house right behind us,
Find me there!,
I had some questions,
The club is caked in dried blood and of crude design,
It has the look of a tool used well and often,
Basilo offers up a chuckle that is chillingly out of place as he pats it,
"Every now and then, Mother Maelstrom offers up little fish that have a bit of fight left in them",
All Basilo does is help put them to rest,
How many 'fish' did you put to sleep today?,
He looks taken aback by the question,
Basilo did them all nice,
Just like father taught him!,
Anyone still squirming gets a knock on his shell till he’s good and floppy,
Not to worry,
Been doing it for years,
Used to help my da’ hold em down while he did the knocking,
Quick as you like,
Basilo offers an eager smile as if to reassure you that he’s very good at what he does,
You murder survivors to steal their belongings?,
You monster!,
Basilo fidgets in obvious discomfort at not understanding what you’re trying to get at,
The drowned men belong to Mother Maelstrom!,
Doesn’t matter if a few of them manage to wriggle onto shore for a last gulp of air,
They’re drowned men nonetheless and all Basilo is doing is sending them back to where they belong,
That’s the way we used to do on these islands,
"Now, most folk have forgotten",
But not me,
Not Basilo,
My family has been here for a long time,
You deserve death!,
"The man slinks off into the fog, heading north",
"As his form dissolves into the nothingness of the mist, you can hear him muttering to himself excitedly",
No need for Basilo to risk his hide!,
You seem fit enough and I’ve got coin!,
I’ll buy whatever you bring me,
Might even have a piece or two to sell if you’re interested,
Just beware them clippers,
Clippers?,
I'd rather end you right here!,
Not here out in the cold!,
Find Basilo up by the farmhouse,
Might even have some soup cooking for you,
There's the one who cheated Mother Maelstrom!,
And loaded with trinkets for old Basilo perhaps?,
There might be some fine coin in it for you,
The old man shakes a worn leather pouch at you that clinks with the sound of coins,
Stay as long as ye like,
Just don’t drink the water in the well,
Best not drink the water there,
Tastes funny and gives you strange dreams,
"Besides, the children mostly use it for their games these days",
#IdraLandingHowl,
A blood-curdling howl cuts through the fog,
"Whatever its source, it’s not far away and it sounds dangerous",
It may be unwise to proceed if you are still alone and poorly armed,
#,
# Chapter_1_Lighthouse,
#,
#Chapter1DeadSailors,
The stench of rotting flesh fills your nostrils,
"Ahead of you, grotesquely misshapen crustacean horrors feast greedily on the corpses of the dead crew of the Zephyr",
Blasted horrors!,
Kat spits through gritted teeth!,
What manner of force has spawned these creatures?,
#Chapter1IdraLighthouseCave,
"The weathered box crumbles as you touch it, revealing an ancient knife of exquisitely carved greenish stone",
With trembling hands you pick it up and for a moment the air around you seems to become charged with eldritch energies,
Sounds die down and your nostrils fill with the metallic tinge of ozone,
No doubt this is the object Mathias the lighthousekeeper asked you to retrieve,
No doubt the blade is an object of strange and ancient magics,
"A sickly, wet bubbling sound snaps you back into focus",
"All around you, the clay jars begin to stir and then, one after another, they burst with loud cracks as a thick substance pours from them",
"To your horror, the viscous substance begins to move of its own volition towards you!",
"Driina slowly walks around the slab, taking in the strange sight",
There is ritual at work here,
Though nothing like the Imperial rites of Sepulcation,
This is something different,
There is a sense of technicality to it,
Like children observing a parent practicing some complex craft and trying to emulate it,
She shudders,
It terrifies me,
The dead stare indignantly at you with empty eye sockets as you examine their naked forms,
You find several lesions on them - no doubt caused by the strange instruments that surround them,
"As to the purpose of the cuts, you have no idea",
As you look more closely it becomes clear to you that these are not the incisions that are commonly associated with the removal of organs for embalming,
"In fact, from what you can tell, the corpses’ organs are still intact",
This ritual seems to have served another purpose,
"Though what, you cannot possibly guess",
Carefully brushing away dust and cobwebs you survey the oddly shaped instruments,
"Their shapes vary from small blades to hooks and other, stranger forms",
You have no idea as to their purpose,
"As you stand there pondering the strange scene before you, your eyes fall on a small wooden box",
Examine the box,
Even a cursory examination reveals that these instruments were likely used on the corpses but as far as you can tell they do not seem to be embalming tools,
Instead they seem more like primitive imitations of the tools Imperial surgeons use,
An Ancient Corpse,
Two desiccated corpses lie carefully placed on a carved stone slab,
There is a deliberateness in their arrangement that gives the strong impression of forgotten secrets and ancient rituals,
Scattered about the corpses are several strange looking metal instruments,
Examine the corpses,
"Driina, what do you make of this?",
Examine the instruments,
Sprawled on the ground ahead of you lies the mangled body of a man,
Stacked high against the walls behind the poor fellow are crates of goods and you have a feeling you've stumbled upon a smuggler's hideout,
One that has seen fairly recent use,
You enter into the larger chamber ahead and the temperature drops noticeably,
"As the swirling dust and ghostly vapors subside, you make out the intimidating form of an ancient, carved monolith",
"Painted on its face, you immediately recognize the crude spiral sign you saw on the standing stones above ground",
"Painted on its face, you can make out the crude shape of a red spiral",
"Carefully arranged before the monolith lies two diminutive, desiccated corpses and along the edges of the chamber stand strange urns of unknown design",
The chamber has an aura of age beyond comprehension and your head begins to spin as you realize you may be the first to set foot in it for millennia,
We shouldn't be here,
Kat whispers behind you,
The Tunnel,
Creeping through the narrow and cobweb covered tunnel it occurs to you that you’re likely the first to use it in decades,
"It appears that neither the smugglers, nor whoever lies on the other end of the tunnel, knew of its existence",
The wall ahead is no doubt another door and you put your shoulder to it,
"Expecting the massive slab of rock to be heavy, you're surprised to find it easily swings open and you nearly stumble into the room ahead",
"It occurs to you that given the doors clever design, there would likely have been no way of finding this door from the other side",
#Chapter1Lighthouse,
Mathias seems troubled by the questions and shifts uncomfortably,
Had an assistant,
Caspar,
"Went mad, the fool did!",
Had a head full of grand ideas and I kept telling him,
This here is a place for the quiet mind,
Threw himself from the tower,
Found him broken on the cliffs,
I can’t be blamed!,
Mathias’ jaw quivers and his eyes water over,
Mathias begins sobbing,
I should have known,
Gotten him off this rock,
When he started talking about the cave and something about a blade calling him I should have known,
I could have saved him but I couldn’t bear the thought of being alone again,
The silence is unbearable!,
Ask about the cave and blade,
He would babble about the cave underneath here for hours,
I’d tell him those were smuggler’s caves and that he was to leave them alone!,
Smugglers keep to themselves but no telling what they’ll do if you bother em,
"As to the 'blade' he talked about, that must’ve been the ravings of a mad man?",
A soul lost to drink and loneliness!,
Oh poor boy,
Mathias wipes his eyes and exhales wearily,
Then again,
What if it is down there?,
The black blade,
"Hidden in some ancient recess, glistening in the dark",
Mathias’ gaze grows distant for a moment,
"If it is, we needs to retrieve the blasted thing and destroy it!",
And that's where I come in?,
Would you help an old man set things right?,
I’ll make it worth your while!,
Find that black blade and bring it here,
I needs to see the thing that took Caspar at least once before we destroy it!,
The entrance to the cave lies in the gully underneath the broken bridge,
Be careful!,
I think I've already found the blade in question,
You mentioned smugglers?,
I should get going,
Go to the smuggler-caves beneath the lighthouse and seek the blade that Caspar saw in his dreams,
You’ll find the cave entrance underneath the broken bridge but once inside I know nothing save that the blade lies in deepest darkness,
Show the ancient dagger,
I had a few more questions!,
Show it!,
the old man stammers excitedly,
"As you reveal the blade to him, his eyes widen and he tentatively reaches out for it",
It’s… beautiful,
Then his jaw clenches in determination and he recoils in apparent disgust,
But it’s evil,
Cursed I tell you!,
Don’t you feel it?,
It has power!,
And hunger,
I want nothing to do with this,
Take it and bring it far away from here,
Destroy it!,
All I would ask is you don’t throw it in the ocean,
There are beings there that would wield it,
"In any case, I promised to make it worth your while and I will",
Take this!,
The old man hands you an amulet,
This’ll serve you well on your journeys,
It’ll keep your body strong and free of disease!,
"That being said, I would ask another thing of you",
"Horryn went dark, about the same time the animals ran amok",
"There was smoke on the wind - and screams too, I could swear it",
Sounded like battle,
Or perhaps slaughter is more like it,
But I think there is a camp of sorts just north of town,
Ragged tents and such,
Survivors perhaps?,
I thought about going there to see for myself,
But I changed my mind,
"The old man hangs his head dejectedly, before continuing in a whisper",
Safer here,
Tending to the light,
"As you enter the lighthouse gallery, a haggard face peers out at you from the gloom",
"Moving closer, you see it belongs to an old man, who clutches a makeshift spear tightly to his chest",
Somehow he looks both fearful yet greatly relieved to see you,
Mother of maelstroms!,
The man croaks,
"Who are ye, then?",
Who did I summon?,
"Come, sit, you must be weary",
Sit!,
The man gestures frantically to a battered chair in the corner,
Travellers,
Nothing more,
I was shipwrecked here,
By something foul,
"Either way, the tides have brought ye to me!",
I knew my signals and prayers would be answered,
"The mother of maelstroms is a cruel mistress, it must be said, it's only fit she repays me in such a darkened hour",
What happened here?,
We were shipwrecked,
By a leviathan,
Something foul is growing on Idra,
A taint on the land!,
There are lights!,
Lights as you've never seen; like those sailors from the high north talk of,
But the colors,
It's like they bleed into your very dreams!,
If you can manage to sleep that is,
It got to the animals first though,
Warped them in both mind and body!,
Made 'em cruel and dangerous,
I ain't never seen nothing like it!,
It's unnatural I tell you!,
"But worse still, Horryn is dead as a tomb!",
Was a right bedlam of cries and screams two days ago - then nothing!,
Not as much as a lit candle at night!,
"Only the deep itself knows the truth of these happenings, but I can tell you this: the island is doomed!",
The sea itself will rise to claim us!,
I need some information,
Foolish superstition,
I need proper information!,
"There are all manner of beasts in the deep oceans of our world, but never have I seen anything like this!",
"A horror from beyond the natural it was, that pulled down that ship!",
I saw it all from my tower I did,
Though I wish I did not have to bear such a sight,
I can hardly belive that anyone could survive such a nightmare,
I did,
It matters not,
"How then did the tides release you, when so many others were claimed?",
The keeper leans in and fixes you with an unwavering gaze,
Are you blessed?,
Or perhaps cursed is more like it?,
Cursed?,
"Neither, I think",
"Now, what happened here?",
Oh you have more important matters to deal with?,
"Well, I must keep watching...seeing",
"The old man trails off, eyes unfocusing",
Forgive me for not being of more help,
We really need to go,
You're a fool to go!,
There is nothing beyond the light but despair!,
And,
The old man sighs,
"But, I'll be here waiting here for you",
For when you return,
As I must,
"Anything, ye may ask!",
We're safe as can be here,
The old man seems eager at the prospect of conversation,
Ask about the Santa Fury,
How long have you been alone?,
There are smugglers on Idra?,
Tell me about Horryn,
What did you need me to do again?,
Remind me what you needed!,
"Actually, I should make ready to leave",
This here beacon is all's keeping the horrors of this island from my throat!,
"Thing is, oil is running low and I got nary a drop left in storage",
I need you to find me some oil afore darkness takes us!,
"Thing is, the oil was coming from the mainland on ships through Horryn",
Then things went dark and now there’s no way for me to get to it,
"If it’s still in Horryn, there’s a good chance it’ll be sitting in one of the warehouses in the harbor",
I'll do my best,
Show oil,
That’s all I ask,
"I’ll be waiting here for you, tending the fire as best I can",
I’m running out of oil!,
I suspect the shipment is stuck in a warehouse in Horryn and I need you to search for it there,
You’ll likely find it in one of the warehouses on the waterfront,
Give oil,
"Blessed Dead, I knew you could do it!",
"If nothing else, seeing the light still burning bright is bound to give people hope!",
Emperor’s Light and all!,
Let's hope so!,
All I have to offer in way of reward is my old sword,
It once served me well but it's getting too heavy for me now,
"Mathias produces an old, but well-crafted broadsword wrapped in cloth",
I'll be on my way now,
Ye're back,
"I knew ye'd seek safe harbor once more, drawn to the light like lost moths",
"Well then; Sit, rest, make yourself at home",
There might still be some stew left,
I found the black blade,
I have oil for you!,
I don't have time to linger!,
I can't say I've ever heard about a ship by that name,
"And let me tell you, I've worked this lighthouse for a man’s age and I’ll say this much",
There’s no ship to be found around here as far as I know!,
Idra's thick with them,
Carrying wares to the mainland for the Freythen,
Island’s riddled with caves and they use them to store their contraband and whatnot,
But they keep to themselves and I want no trouble so I let them be,
#Chapter1LighthouseMisc,
"For all its alienness, you still recognize the arcane machinery",
An ancient Imperial reticular node,
You suspect this lighthouse was once fueled by reticular energy and that this machine was part of its operation,
"The stillness and layer of dust, however, tell you that it's long since fallen into disrepair and that the lighthouse is likely now fueled by common oil",
"As you stand there, beholding the strange machine, you become aware of the scraping of tiny claws in the darkness",
Then chittering,
As you reach for your weapon the strange harmonics of the chittering converge and for the briefest of moments you could have sworn you heard words formed,
Half a dozen beasts launch at you from the dark corners of the room with fangs bared!,
Creeping through the moldy lighthouse cellar you round a corner and stop dead in your tracks,
"Rising up through the core of the tower, is a grotesque-looking metallic monstrosity",
The strangely organic shapes and odd geometries seem to writhe in the dim light and the burnished sylver coating casts a ghostly reflection on the walls,
#Chapter1LighthouseQuest,
There is nothing more you can do for me right now,
What of it?,
What can I do to help?,
About that job,
Remind me what you need,
I have the oil!,
Glad to help,
Mathias stares absent mindedly into the fire,
I was wondering about something else,
It's time to leave,
#Chapter1UWMaze,
"You utter an underwater scream of pain and terror but before you can act further, the creature has retreated back into one of the holes",
Swim south,
"Quickly rummaging through the poor fellows belongings, you try not to think about your own dwindling air supply",
In a pouch on his belt you find a handful of coins and a key,
"Now, you’ve lingered too long already and you must move on",
Tunnels lead to the north and west,
Swim north,
Swim west,
You break the surface and find yourself back in the cave system where you started,
"For all its bleakness, you nonetheless feel a sense of relief at returning to this area",
You break the surface and emerge into an alien world,
The air is stale and damp and the walls are so covered in algae and fungus that they almost appear to writhe,
"In the faint bioluminescence of the cave's bizarre underwater flora, you make out three passages",
North and east takes you further into the cave system whilst west leads back to the surface,
Swim east,
A large domed chamber,
Writing sea-weed covers the floor and reaches up towards you like groping tentacles,
You shudder as one of the slimy tendrils brush your skin,
Three tunnels lead out of this chamber,
"East, west and south",
The tunnel narrows somewhat here before opening up into a slightly larger chamber with two exits,
West and south,
The bioluminescence is so faint in this chamber that you almost fail to spot the tunnels leading north and east,
Suspended in the middle of this chamber is the corpse of a young man,
His features are softened by the sickly glow of the algae growing here but there is no mistaking the mask of terror that froze on his face as he drowned,
A bend where the tunnel leads east or south,
Sharp limpet-like growths cover the wall and you take care not to cut yourself as you squeeze past,
"This chamber is flat with a low ceiling and three tunnels leading north, east and west",
The walls of this bulbous chamber are pockmarked with a dozen smaller tube-like holes leading deeper into the bedrock,
"As you contemplate the folly of sticking your hand into one of them, an eel-like creature darts from one of the holes and bites into your flesh with tiny, razor sharp fangs",
This chamber is bathed in a greenish glow coming from the eastern tunnel that leads to the surface,
The western exit leads deeper into the cave system,
Underwater Tunnel,
You find yourself at the opening of a narrow underwater tunnel and wonder how long you can hold your breath,
Do you dive in?,
Dive into the tunnel,
This narrow underwater tunnel serves as the only exit from this cave,
You hope you remember the way back,
#SantaFury,
Carylla,
"A sinewy, armored woman with a shield slung on her back and a broadsword at her side stands by a small campfire",
She’s grunting and cursing under her breath as she clumsily tries to bind a wound on her arm,
Dried blood and mud cakes her face and armor and she looks haggard,
She freezes as she sees you emerge from the fog,
A suspicious frown falls over her face,
Let me help you!,
she growls as she finishes the tourniquet using her good arm and teeth,
Bless you for offering but I can manage,
I would kill for some water though!,
Offer her a drink from your waterskin,
Name’s Carylla,
Used to call myself captain of our little mercenary company,
Some rich trader from Adler’s paid us well to come here and look for the Fury,
Things went to shit quickly,
I’ve been losing my crew one by one,
Nillas and Pieter ‘got their coins’ yesterday,
Torn to pieces by those fucking hounds,
It’s just me now,
What’s the Fury?,
Carylla packs up her gear and begins to carefully make her way through the mist until she’s gone,
I would hate to see you spill your guts on this bloody island looking for some ghost-ship,
"Then again, you might have better luck then me and my",
Carylla stops briefly and her eyes water up,
Just be careful,
Idra’s not peaceful any more and I suspect there are things out in the mist far worse than the hounds,
Honestly I don’t know where to start,
There were lights in the sky,
Flashes and orbs,
Some over Horryn and others over the island’s interior,
Minor quakes even,
And then things went real bad,
People lost their minds and animals started changing,
What terrifies me is I can’t even tell you how long that was ago!,
Her voice rises in an anxious tone,
I just need to get away from here!,
Off this fucking rock!,
What will you do now?,
"I’ll try to make my way east, around the bay",
Maybe there are larger groups of survivors there and perhaps even someone with a way of getting away from here,
"And if you ever find that bloody treasure, buy me a drink next time we run into each other",
A Painting,
"Hanging on the wall, you see a dramatic but not particularly artful painting of a ship with torn sails caught in a terrible storm",
Your mind wanders to the Zephyr and its grizzly fate and you shudder,
Look closer,
Leaning in you notice that there is a name painted on the side of the ship,
The Santa Fury,
Could this be it?,
Is this what the rumor that the Santa Fury could be found near the lighthouse on Idra meant?,
Examine the painting even closer,
Examining the painting more carefully reveals nothing,
Not until you turn it over!,
Written in faint lettering in the lower left corner of the painting's backside you can clearly make out a poem of sorts,
The Poem,
"From the center of the three, The Santy Fury made her flight",
"Setting out to hide her booty, All within the lighthouse's sight",
"leagues south began her trip, ""5 east"" the Captain cried. 4 more north, our valiant ship, Our plunder we shall hide!",
Land ahoy!,
went up the roar,
We'll lay our treasure there!,
"Into the rising sun: 3 more, Then dig and have no fear!",
You hastily take down the poem in your journal,
Excitement washes over you as you realize that you may in fact be on the trail of something more than an old sailor’s tale!,
If you can make sense of the poem that is,
A wise call,
You may go far yet,
But a friendly piece of advice between colleagues,
Don’t search for us,
Forget this ever happened and move on,
She offers a short bow before the group dissolves back into the fog with the idol in hand,
Silence descends around you as you pick up the jewelry left behind,
It will certainly fetch a nice purse,
Yet you cannot shake the image of that grotesque idol from your mind,
Part of you prays you never see it again whilst another knows with absolute certainty you will,
What!,
Never heard of the Santa Fury?,
"She was an Ombarian treasure-ship, they say",
Disappeared around 40 cycles ago and it’s said she was laden heavy when she went,
People been looking for her ever since,
"Me, I never put any stock in the legend",
Sailor’s tale,
But then this rich fop from Adler’s up and offered to pay me and my company to go here and look for it,
"Well, 'easy money' we thought",
"Idra’s not huge and according to the trader, rumor had it she lay on dry land near the lighthouse",
"And there’s only one lighthouse on Idra see, so sounded easy enough",
No reason to expect any bloodshed either,
Idra used to be nice and peaceful,
Our steel was mostly in case we did find it and needed to guard any treasure,
"Needless to say, that’s not how it went",
You didn’t find anything?,
Not a scrap,
We've searched every inch of this island and let me tell you,
The Santa Fury’s not here!,
It bloody can’t be!,
A fucking ship on dry land?,
And near the lighthouse nonetheless?,
It does not exist!,
Mind if I give it a go?,
Buried Treasure,
"Digging through the rocky soil, you’re almost ready to give up then your shovel suddenly strikes something metallic",
A small but sturdy strong-box,
"Though it appears to have something inside, this is far from the fabled mountains of gold that Ombarian treasure-ships were said to carry",
Open the box,
The box swings open without difficulty,
Inside lies a small pile of strange and exotic looking jewelry,
And underneath it: an artifact wrapped in rough linen,
"As you reach for it, a ringing rises in your ears and you go light headed",
Excitement?,
Something else,
"The bundle tumbles from your hands and as it does, it becomes unwrapped",
Laying on the ground in front of you is a hideous idol carved from some unknown greenish-black rock,
"An amorphous shape of eyes, mouths and tentacles that manages to convey a sense of immensity in spite of the effigy’s small size",
Hand over the idol,
The voice cuts through the mist like a dagger,
You turn around to see Carylla and a handful of other shapes approaching threateningly with weapons drawn,
I can’t bloody believe it!,
It worked!,
I told you all it would,
one of the men flanking Carylla rants excitedly before she cuts him off with a poisonous glance,
Shut your bloody trap Pieter!,
You!,
she points her sword towards you,
Hand over the idol!,
Kick it over,
Not going to happen!,
The men I work for,
They will go so much further than just spilling your blood to get what they seek,
"A smile, strangely sympathetic, flashes over her face",
Then she clicks her tongue and the men flanking her charge!,
#,
# Chapter_1_RefugeeCamp,

#Chapter1Chamberlain,
"From what I hear, these men were bands of local fishermen and sailors!",
But why would they do something like this?,
"Horryn was their home and for all his shortcomings, there were few Imperial officials as lenient as the governor!",
Where is the governor now?,
I didn't see him as we fle,
I mean 'made our strategic retreat',
I can only assume he died in the chaos,
And the cruelest joke of all,
That leaves me the ranking Imperial Official on the island,
Farewell for now,
Driina scowls at you,
Markus shakes his head dejectedly,
I’m certainly not going to beg you for aid,
"But I’ll say, if there exists a way to retake the city, I believe it is contingent on the survival of this camp",
"Beyond that, I bid you go to whatever fate awaits you",
What can I do to help then?,
The color drains from Markus' face,
But… but Driina are you leaving as well?,
I need you here in camp,
We've already discussed this!,
I cannot do this without you!,
I'm not a leader - I'm a glorified scribe!,
Who will keep their spirits up?,
And what am I going to do when people start dying from the outbreak?,
All the blood and shit and,
"You will find your strength, my old friend",
The Golden Dead will guide you,
"Besides, we both know that nothing will be solved by me waiting here in camp",
We must try to seize the initiative in whatever way we can,
Driina puts her hand on his shoulder,
Markus lets out a deep sigh before looking up,
"You are right, Driina",
As always,
Clear your throat,
"Driina, perhaps you should stay here after all",
"Driina motions towards you,",
Gallian himself may have provided for us,
"Markus looks up at you, seemingly having forgotten you were in the tent",
I'm looking for a way into Horryn,
Driina's gaze could shatter stone,
The decision is mine to make And I have made it,
"Now, we have tarried for too long",
"Markus, tell our friend here of Horryn’s fate",
I fear out path leads there eventually,
Go there if you will but entering Horryn may indeed prove a tall order,
Township’s been overrun by madmen!,
Hundreds lie dead in the street and those who remain cling to life on this barren plot of farmland!,
"As for the city gates, they have been sealed and our attackers have left us with no way back into the city",
But what happened?,
It started some days ago,
I was awoken in the middle of the night by the governor's guards,
"They told me we were under attack and that packs of crazed brigands were already roaming the streets, spilling blood by the river-full!",
I never saw such chaos before,
The dead lay strewn in the streets and we had to sneak from corner to corner just to get away with our lives!,
"By some stroke of luck, we came upon Driina and a handful of other guards and managed to make our way to the gate with what survivors we could find!",
We set up this camp whilst we,
Well frankly I don't know,
All I can do is try to keep us alive till tomorrow,
It sounds like you're about to plead for help?,
I'd say no,
Iben the ranger is keeping the city under watch and he reports that the Reavers have sealed its gates,
We’ve found no other way of entering it,
Though what you expect to find in there save a gruesome death is beyond me,
But what do you intend to do then?,
Sit here and wait for death?,
Certainly not!,
"But with the state this camp is in, it’s all we can do to keep death from our throats",
"If we are ever to hold out until reinforcements arrive, much less retake the town, then we must do what we can to gather our strength!",
For now that means food and medicine,
Regarding that,
I best be on my way then,
The Chamberlain,
The man before you has the look of a high-ranking Imperial bureaucrat,
"However, there is little pomp left in him now",
His robes are ragged; his cheeks hollowed; his spectacles cracked,
He mumbles to himself as he despondently pores over stacks of papers and maps,
He looks up at you with a start,
"What's this, then?",
More mouths to feed?,
"Or, by some miracle, do you come laden with supplies, medicine and men-at-arms?",
Driina gives the man a strict look,
"Markus, we’re in no position to turn allies away",
Common courtesy will go a long way,
"Careful, little man",
The man sighs and sinks further back in his seat,
Forgive me,
I'm not myself,
The world seems to be coming undone and I am left holding the pieces,
He wipes his balding head with a piece of cloth,
Markus Stonehold at your service,
Chamberlain to the most glorious office of the Governor of Idra,
"He makes a sharp little bow, his words dripping sarcasm",
How may I be of assistance?,
I'm trying to get to Horryn,
I've come to offer my assistance!,
We are in need of aid,
Me?,
Aid you?,
The man scoffs incredulously,
"At present, we'll be blessed by the Dead if we survive another night or two!",
But I need to get to Horryn!,
Markus blinks bewildered,
He gestures to his papers,
"With the governor missing and the camp overflowing, things are chaotic, to say the least",
Any assistance you can offer will surely help me avoid an early grave,
Driina offers a sympathetic smile,
If I... we can help - we will,
"Nonetheless, I do not know you and though your motives may be pure, I’ve learned a long time ago to be wary of sellswords",
"Tell me, why are you here in the first place?",
The people are starving around us,
Already the very young and the very old have begun to pass and soon none of us will have the strength to fight should the reavers come for us,
"In other words, we need food and we need it fast",
Talk to Frantzo,
He’s serving as our cook and quartermaster and he might know where to start,
You’ll find him just outside this barn,
And you mentioned a disease outbreak?,
Indeed,
Disease is spreading in camp,
"Hierophant Drahl has set up a makeshift infirmary in the main house, but so far he’s had little luck in combating the infection",
Help him and you will have helped us all,
Talk to Frantzo regarding the dwindling food supplies and Drahl regarding the disease outbreak,
And do hurry,
People are dying as we speak,
Markus sits where you left him,
"Grimly pouring over lists, manifests and maps",
"Pushing his broken spectacles up his nose, he peers up at you",
You're back,
I hope for good news!,
Markus sighs deeply,
"If there is nothing else, my migraine needs tending to...amongst other things",
The Chamberlain gestures to the piles of papers surrounding him,
What do you want to know?,
Is there no way of getting into Horryn?,
Any idea who the mad-men who attacked Horryn are?,
Regarding work,
Nothing for now,
He lets out a sigh,
"Oh, where to start?",
This camp is a disaster!,
There is no medicine for the sick and wounded while mad-men and beasts bay for our blood at the gates!,
The haggard man wipes his brow,
Anything I can do to help?,
What did you need again?,
#Chapter1Cook,
Frantzo listens to your description of Embla and strokes his beard,
"I might have seen her, but this hunger is making me hazy",
Help us find something to eat and chances are it'll clear my memory too,
Fair enough,
The name rings a bell,
"Hmm, yes, I remember the girl!",
"She arrived at my inn a few weeks ago, booked a room for two weeks and payed up front",
"She was polite, kept to herself mostly",
"Far as I could tell, she was making trips towards the northern coastline",
"She never gave up any hints as to why, though",
The room was still in her name when the doom came - but I remember thinking I hadn't seen her for days beforehand,
"I wager she was either already dead, or safely on one of her excursions the night everything ended",
"If you're looking for her and have a death wish, she was staying in the 'Sunset Suite', on the second floor",
"My inn, 'The Haven' is...was just off the main square",
Where are they?,
They are waiting in the enclosure behind you!,
They are being kept in a glen up in the foothills!,
Frantzo is thoughtfully peeling onions as he hums a tune in some foreign language,
Good to see you!,
You approach a haggard looking man wearing a threadbare cook's apron,
"I don't know what you heard, but there's no food here for you, or anyone",
he growls,
"Complain to the chamberlain if you want, just leave me alone",
The chamberlain said you needed help,
Likewise,
The cook's eyes meet yours for the first time,
"Honestly, the situation is beyond dire",
People are starving by the day and we have no supplies,
"The old, the sick the young; they'll all be dying off at this rate",
Got any ideas?,
"Well, none of us have the strength or courage left to venture out of sight of the camp to hunt and forage",
The cook looks you up and down,
But you look capable enough,
You could go beyond the walls and look for something more substantial?,
These people can’t live on vegetable broth alone,
They need meat and fat,
Especially if there’s fighting to be had,
Any idea where I should look?,
I do indeed,
Frantzo leans in,
Old Jakub owns this farm,
"It might not seem like much to a mainlander but here on Idra, this farm here is large enough",
"You see, Jakub and his family had a large flock of goats when the calamities started",
Right over there in the enclosure behind us,
"Now, the old man told the chamberlain that the beasts bolted when the calamities started",
That it drove them all insane and that they scattered into the hills,
"Well, that may be rightly so but I have my suspicions",
You're saying he hid the animals away?,
"Look, I can’t say I blame the man",
Us refugees have made a mess of his farm,
And if we find hands on those animals we’ll surely fall upon them like locusts,
It would ruin him and truly it would be a shame if the man lost his livelihood,
But better that than having to see children starve,
Now you best get going,
I see people have started eying the rats,
"If what you say is true, you have a chance to save a lot of people here",
All you have to do is to herd them back to camp,
If you don’t tread carefully though there might be trouble with Jakub and his lad but better that than having to see children starve,
I knew it!,
I bloody knew it!,
And you led them right to us I see!,
By the Maidens this will do these poor people good,
Though I fear for old Jakub if people find out he was hoarding his livestock whilst others were dying,
"In any case, we have food now to last us a while and it is all thanks to you",
I had some questions first,
Bye,
"With impeccable timing, the work party of sailors arrives carrying the crates of supplies",
Frantzo slaps his meaty palms together,
I knew you could do it {PLAYER}!,
You’ve saved a lot of lives today,
Not to mention what people would have done to Jakub if it turned out he had been hiding livestock from them,
I'll see you around,
Well,
What's eating you?,
The cook chuckles darkly,
What's your story?,
Ask about Embla,
Goodbye,
The cook's eyes widen in hope,
"So, what news, did you find anything I can put in folk's bellies?",
I found supplies!,
Good to see you again {PLAYER}!,
My story is similar to most folk around here; sudden ruin,
"I had an inn, respectable place, right on the main square it was",
So even if I survive this place - seems like I have nothing to go back to,
I'm sorry to hear that,
By the maidens tell me it is so!,
Don’t wave food in front of the starving!,
Where did you find it?,
We found Jakub's goats!,
I purchased supplies from smugglers!,
#Chapter1DriinaIntro,
"In the center stands a formidable, armored woman",
She carries an unmistakable air of authority and the insignia on her armour marks her as a cleric of the Order of Sepulchites,
The tattered band of refugees surrounding her are agitated and shouting over one another,
But there are so few of us!,
Horryn was home to two hundred and we're but a few score left!,
cries a ragged man with tears in his eyes,
"By the Golden Corpses, there must be survivors!",
beseeches another,
And who are we to send?,
Half of us won't live through next Marketday and the other half ain't fit to hold 's much as a stick!,
"an old crone interjects, panic quivering in her voice",
The crowd erupts in a cacophony of desperate appeals,
The cleric raises her arms and the crowd falls silent,
Her sonorous voice rings out,
We may indeed be cursed,
"But Aldon is right - there may yet be survivors in Horryn, and it's my duty to go to their aid",
"Or, at least, to learn what fate befell them",
"The assembly errupts again - some blessing the cleric in tears of hope, others clinging to her robes while pleading for her to not risk her life",
"Through the crowd, the woman catches sight of you, and nods curtly",
"She turns away and begins to load up on supplies, no doubt intent on making good on her promise to the panicked refugees",
"Entering the ragged camp, you notice a small crowd nearby, arranged in an inward looking ring",
#Chapter1DriinaMain,
The reavers came from inside the town,
"I recognized some of them as sailors, fishermen and whalers",
"Locals, mostly from old Idran families",
Perhaps they belonged to one of the lodges,
Driina,
The imposing cleric holds up a palm in greeting,
"Welcome to our new home, stranger",
The people of this island know me as Driina,
I serve the Golden Dead and this camp - these people - are under my protection,
What brings you here?,
I was heading to Horryn,
I'm searching for someone,
A terror from the deep claimed our ship,
"Driina nods and smiles to a passing refugee, before leaning in close to you, and asking in a low voice, ""and what business did you have in Horryn?",
We lost our supplies,
I'd hoped to re-stock,
I had hoped to recruit new sword arms,
I was looking for someone,
"She leans back, her eyes still flinty",
Are you not aware of the situation here?,
These people say the island is surely doomed,
Her eyes bore into you - gauging your reaction,
And what say you?,
I couldn't care less for your troubles,
Here on Idra?,
"That may prove to be a difficult task, given the tempest that's engulfed this island",
Driina fidgets with a heavy looking ring on her finger while she listens to your description of Embla,
She's certainly not in the camp and I can't say I remember seeing her in Horryn,
But perhaps that bodes well for your quest,
One of the primary tasks of my order is to care for the dead,
And I can say with certainy that I didn't lay to rest anyone matching her description before the fall of Horryn,
Do you have any suggestions where to look?,
"Beyond travelling to Horryn, you may want to ask around here in camp",
A few of the merchants survived - perhaps she visited one during her stay,
We need answers!,
Driina gestures at the refugees languishing in the camp before continuing,
"And it's my duty to seek them out, if they exist",
I must venture to find a way back into Horryn,
"And thence somewhere darker, I fear",
"Failing that, the situation here in camp is getting untenable",
Anything that can be done to improve it will be a small victory,
Are you planning to go alone?,
Why not wait for reinforcements?,
I care not for this fools errand!,
If I must,
"Doomed or not, it's all dust in the end and I intend to die in armor",
"But, from what I can tell, we must both tread the same terrible path?",
"Though our reasons may differ, surely there is safety to be had in numbers?",
Let's join forces,
"There is no room for you in my company, but I'll help nontheless",
I care not for helping,
"One way or another, Horryn must be investigated, but I cannot be in two places at once and perhaps I can do more good here in camp after all",
"If you go there - please, bring word of what you find",
However grim those tidings may be,
I can do that,
I'm not promising anything,
Some people only care for their own skin,
"But look around you - if some measure of compassion for these people touches your heart, I will be here for a short while yet",
"On second thought, you should join me",
"I'll consider helping, but I don't want you to join me",
Our graveyards have been overflowing as of late with stranger killing stranger for no good reason,
"And worse, I think, brother and brother, husband and wife",
It's become a tide of ruin,
"I implored the Governor to intervene and investigate, but as usual he did nothing but cower in his villa and peer over his walls",
The Governor?,
There is always hope - in this life or beyond it,
"However, I have seen things these last days that I cannot readily explain or reconcile with my faith",
"Then, a few nights ago, pandemonium erupted",
"Bands of armed men and women roamed the town, hacking down anyone they came across",
"Some folks claim those that did not die on the spot were dragged away, to suffer some unknown fate",
My order and I joined what sane guardsmen remained in the chaos and tried to stem the tide - but we were driven from the city in the panicked exodus that followed,
"We considered retaking the town, but we had scores of wounded",
"So we retreated, better to save the lives not yet lost",
"We set up this camp to regroup and to care for the wounded, but a shadow hangs over us",
"The wounded do not recover, and those still on their feet slowly lose their mind, or hearts",
What do you intend to do now?,
Driina's face lights for an instant,
These people - my people - I feel their pain,
"And we will mourn together, later",
"For now, they deserve answers",
"And by the Emperors' bones, I will get them some",
Then that is the course laid out for us,
I pray your resolve may help you through the darkness that lies ahead,
"I will not barter for what should be an act of compassion, given freely, if that is what you're implying",
"Either way, I wish you luck",
I both look forward to and dread seeing you again,
I have questions,
A drunken buffoon in my estimation,
"He did not deserve to die however, and I don't think he made it out of Horryn",
"Markus, his chamberlain did however",
I suppose he's the closest we're to a leader at the moment - though he may wish it were not so,
What happened next?,
Let's be off!,
The Golden Dead watch over you,
Then we have nothing to dicuss!,
Begone!,
The cleric turns her back on you and continues her preparations,
There are long traditions on Idra for the fishermen and sailors to band together in fellowships known as lodges,
"From what I understand, they serve mainly as combines for fair distribution of the day's catch",
But there are persistent rumors of them serving other purposes too,
Rumors?,
"Our Order is an Imperial one - the locals would be loath to discuss such things with us - but I've always suspected they practiced pre-Imperial customs of ocean-worship, including offerings to ensure safe travel and bountiful catches",
"Driina looks expectantly at you, one brow arched",
Ask Driina about Embla,
Who do you think attacked Horryn?,
It's time to go,
Before we leave we should seek out Markus - our leader of sorts,
He's holed up in the stable trying to organize this mess of a camp,
"Holy Ashes, no one tries harder than him, but the task at hand is monumental and he needs help",
"If you feel the calling, you should seek out Markus - our leader of sorts",
Reinforcements?,
From whence?,
"Even if the Imperial Augers are aware of our plight, relief will still be weeks away if it arrives at all",
"No, our fate is in our own hands and I fear I must bear the brunt of the hardships ahead",
And you would venture out alone?,
Driina looks up at you with steely eyes and offers a curt greeting,
Golden Dead watch over you,
I have some questions for you,
I want you to join me!,
You speak of the leviathan,
The fishermen first saw it about a week before the fall of Horryn,
"I do not know what black depths spawned it, but the natural order of things is fast becoming undone",
"Tell me, why did you come to this accursed island?",
I'm lookong for someone,
I was bound for Horryn,
#Chapter1Farmer,
What of them?,
I found them up in the glen,
What happened to them?,
The man mutters something under his breath and spits as a group of refugees pass,
As he notices you lingering he fixes you with a bitter frown,
More leeches come to bleed me?,
Is this your farm?,
He scoffs,
If you can still call it that!,
It's ruined,
All my crops are trampled and my goats are gone!,
We're going to starve next year thanks to this catastrophe!,
Still seems you're better off than the people living in the camp,
Spare me the sob-story,
"A balding man with a hard, wrinkled face the texture of old leather, stands leaning against the wall of the farmhouse",
He’s thoughtfully chewing a straw as he dejectedly surveys the muddy chaos that was once his well-kept farm,
Approach,
He scoffs and turns his back to you,
"Wait, I have some questions",
The man's eyes narrow,
He begins to whittle away at a stick and won't look directly at you,
It's clear he knows what you're talking about,
You can't keep hiding such a large herd while the camp starves,
Your boy is begging to come home,
I'll keep your herd a secret for a price,
Begging?,
The boy's soft,
If he wants to come home he needs to prove himself!,
I'm doing this for his own good,
Is it gold you're after then?!,
The man’s face goes red as he takes a step towards you,
He stands there for a moment trembling with rage before looking around and becoming aware that the other people of the camp are watching,
You’re cruel indeed to fleece an old man so close to his skin,
But I can’t lose my animals,
"Take this, and may your bones be ground to dust",
He presses a small pouch of 50 gold into your hand,
Get out of here before I let my axe do the talking!,
I'm bringing the animals to the camp one way or another,
I want no part in this,
The man's face reddens,
I can and I will!,
It's their fault we're in this mess!,
Dead,
They must be,
"Ran off into the forest when the sky fell, and nothing survives in that emperor's-foresaken place for long",
Are you lying to me?,
Tell me the truth or I'll be forced to make you,
The old man shifts uncomfortably,
He looks down at his feet and sighs,
"I know it ain't right, but we borrowed hard from the Free-Lenders Guild to build this farm, and my goats...they're all I have left",
"If I lose them too, I'm done for",
"Me, my wife and son, indenturement for the lot of us!",
Where are the animals now?,
The old man looks at you unflinchingly,
I am telling you the truth,
The farmer hesitates for a moment and then his face hardens,
Fuck you and fuck this rotten pack of beggars and thieves,
I’ll die before I tell you,
That can be arranged,
The man's eyes narrow and you can see his jaw-muscles tensing,
How do you feel about the camp?,
About your animals,
Bloody wretches,
They could have gone anywhere!,
But my farms were closest and now they've picked me clean and trampled my fields,
We're ruined!,
The farmers eyes flare with rage and defiance,
The people of this camp need the food,
Perhaps you can get a fair price from the chamberlain?,
The animals will die in those mountains,
It's better to slaughter them now and put the meat to good use,
This herd is coming back one way or another!,
I need to think about this,
The man’s grim mask gives way to deep sadness,
You win,
We’re done for,
Could you at least go help my boy and make sure they make it to camp safely?,
I wanted to ask you some questions,
The old man’s eyes seem to go black with rage,
You think you can threaten me?!,
Get out of my sight before I plant my ax in your skull!,
You have no doubt he means it,
#Chapter1FarmersWife,
The woman looks at you apprehensively for a bit,
Not as long as these people are on our land,
Aiden has to keep the goats safe,
Up in the hidden glen,
I could go check on him?,
She wipes a tear of relief,
Thank you so much,
Go to the old goat enclosure east of our house and find the hole in the fence to the north,
If you look careful you’ll find some tracks,
Follow them and they should take you right to the glen,
And please don’t tell Jakub I’ve talked to you,
He only cares for the animals and he has a horrible temper,
The Farmer's Wife,
The woman looks tired and sad as she wanders around the farmhouse aimlessly,
My poor boy,
she mutters under her breath,
What's wrong with your boy?,
Poor Aiden’s stuck outside in the rain and fog,
Jakub won’t let him come home,
Not as long as,
As long as?,
#Chapter1GenericRefugee,
A soldier dressed in the ragged remains of what you assume is the livery of Horryn,
"He looks hungry, shaken and on edge",
Talk to the chamberlain over in the barn if you want something - Just leave me alone!,
#Chapter1GoatTracks,
"Trekking a few hours into the mountainous highlands of Idra’s north-western region, you find yourself standing at the mouth of a narrow valley nestled between tall mountains",
The tracks do not lie,
There are goats nearby,
You fail to make out any additional details about the prints,
"Looking closer, you can clearly make out a set of human footprints as well",
It seems clear that these animals were herded out of the enclosure,
Dozens of cloven hooves have churned a path trought the mud heading north into the foothills behind the camp,
Follow directions to the hidden glen,
Try to follow the tracks,
Examine the tracks more closely,
"Trecking throught the rugged foothills, you follow the tracks until they pass over a portion of bare rock",
You lose the trail and after a brief period of searching you decide to give up and return to camp,
You must discover the destination of these tracks some other way,
"The flock seems to have been driven out of camp, towards the north-west",
"Across rocky grounds and soggy marshes, you manage to stay on the trail",
#Chapter1GraveDigger,
With trembling hands you cut into the pallid flesh and expose the entrails of the corpse,
Driina leans in over your shoulder,
Those entrails don't look,
"Her words are cut short as the 'entrails' whip out of the wound in a mass of squirming, eyeless worms!",
"Panicked, you frantically scuttle away from the tiny snapping orifices when Roland charges past you with the shovel raised",
"Panicked, you frantically scuttle away from the tiny snapping orifices till your hand instinctivly finds the shaft of the shovel!",
"Just as you are about to abandon your grizzley task, when the 'entrails' whip out of the wound in a mass of squirming, eyeless worms!",
"The shovel makes short work of the tiny terrors, until both corpse and monster is reduced to a pulpy mass",
"Ashen-faced from horror, you push the broken corpses into their graves and quickly begin piling dirt onto them",
"As you work, Driina begins chanting",
Finish the work,
I'd rather have you lend a hand Driina,
Your words offer comfort,
There are two corpses wrapped in linen before you,
Their graves have been dug but they still need to be filled in,
Examine corpses,
The corpses are a man and a woman,
Perhaps they were once man and wife,
They look well fed and there is no apparent cause of death,
Driina looks stoically at the pair,
They are with the Emperors now,
Though I wonder what killed them,
Investigate corpses more closely,
Bury the corpses,
Place the corpses in their graves,
They look well fed and there is no apperant cause of death,
Harvest meat from the corpses,
"As you look the corpses over, you notice that their abdomens seem distended beyond that of simple corpse gas",
"You apprehensively poke at the swelling and to your horror, the mass begins to squirm and shift!",
Hastily bury the corpses,
Cut open the corpses,
You examine the pair more closely but don't learn anything of interest,
You carve several large slabs of flesh from the well-fed corpses,
You cannot help but think about how hungry you are,
Bury corpses and leave,
Driina looks at the man with a sad smile,
The dead must be put in the ground lest disease run rampant,
But take comfort: tending to the dead is holy work,
You'll have earned the grace of the Golden Tomb,
The man looks down in shame,
It's just that it doesn't feel like it is all,
Driina says we need to bury the dead lest disease runs rampant and how it's holy work,
You mentioned hounds?,
Have you lost your mind?,
I'd die before I'll let you deface these corpses!,
The camp needs food and these are more well fed than most!,
Waht are you talking about?,
I'm sorry I don't know what came over me,
The flesh of the dead is sacred!,
I'm oath-sworn to protect and care for it and necrophagia is among the foulest of sins!,
We will feast on flesh!,
You reget is genunine,
I forgive your transgression,
It is this island - it turns our thoughs unsound,
Let's just bury these wretches and be done with it,
Bury corpses,
You have lost your mind!,
It is just as well we meet our end here,
Driina charges at you!,
You wipe the grime from your face as you finish the grim task,
"Sadly, you suspect these are far from the last graves that will be made for the poor refugees of Horryn before this is over",
You place the corpses in their graves and quickly fill them in,
It is hard work and the rugged widlerness around you looms threathningly,
"As you work, Driina stands above you, chanting",
Your words offer comfort to living and dead both,
So many have died the last days without proper burial or recieving their Rites of Sepulcation,
I need to do this,
You finish the work in silence,
Driina smiles slightly,
This offers me some small peace of mind,
The darkness of night is pressing in around you and as you prepare to leave you notice movement just past the edge of the darkness,
"Before you manage to call out, slavering horrors charge at you!",
Haven't you seen 'em?,
Bloody monsters roam the hills in packs!,
I ain't never seen hounds like these before,
Hulking and diseased-looking,
Come at night they do,
Dig up the graves I dig and eat the dead right out of their very graves!,
Driina whispers a few words under her breath,
The dead?,
In the distance a howl sounds and the man straightens up like some prey animal sensing a predator,
He briefly squints into the perpetual twilight that covers the island before grabbing his shovel and redoubling his efforts towards finishing his work,
Run back to camp - I'll finish the job,
Well you better hurry up then,
You approach a man sweating profusely and caked in dirt,
"He's hunched over and panting, seemingly winded from the hard work of digging graves",
Who goes there!,
The man jolts to hefting his shovel as a weapon,
I'm not looking for trouble,
Why so jumpy?,
Why so jumpy he asks!,
"Well since you ask, I drew the short straw and it's fallen upon my wretched shoulders to bury the dead",
He shoots Driina a sulking glance,
"And if I don't get back to it, I'll be food for the fell-hounds afore you know it!",
He looks around nervously,
Why so jumpy she asks!,
Fell-hounds?,
The man looks at you with slight confusion then pushes his shovel into your hands,
He thanks you profusely and runs back to camp,
Driina nods in approval,
That was a good deed,
Get to work,
The grave-digger looks up with a nervous look on his eyes,
Let me help you,
The poor gravedigger looks at you with a grateful smile,
He seems to have made no attempt at removing some of the grime that covers him,
No doubt he realizes he'll be back to work before long,
#Chapter1IagoMessenger,
A man with leather-like skin covered in sailor’s tattoos approaches you,
Greetings m’lord,
Greetings m’lady,
"Name’s Donovan, ‘Dono’ for short and I’m here looking for someone a lot like you!",
"Well, begging your pardon but you look less covered in shit than the rest of this lot and able to carry a blade m’lord",
"Well, begging your pardon but you look less covered in shit than the rest of this lot and able to carry a blade m’lady",
I serve on the vessel ‘Weathermaiden’ and I’m here on the orders of my first-mate Zhara,
I've already talked to Zhara!,
"Dono offers a clumsy bow before making his way out of camp, heading north-west",
The man blinks in relief,
Well in that case it seems I’ve done my job exceptionally well!,
May the Mother of Maelstroms guide you in finding Captain Iago!,
Better you talk to her yourself!,
We’re holed up in a large sea-cave west of here while the ‘maiden’ is undergoing repairs,
Zhara will be waiting for you there,
"Here, I’ll show you on your map",
Dono indicates the position 66 by 91 on your map of the Outer Isles,
I must ask you do not delay,
#Chapter1Iben,
"The Reavers are fierce, but they are a poorly organized lot",
With a small troupe of hungry and fearful guardsmen I was able to fight my way to the square and slay many of their numbers,
"If this is a trap, I believe it to be a poorly laid one",
And what did you have in mind?,
The situation inside the city is still unclear but what we do know is that the Reavers have formed factions,
"Though some are doubtlessly still rabid, others may be open to parlaying",
"If this is so, we might be able to use that to our advantage",
"In other words, we fight when we must but if we can use cunning instead I’m certain the Dead will favor us!",
Venture forth!,
Now pay close attention!,
Iben leans in intently,
You’ll enter Horryn by the Fishermen’s Gate to the south east,
Once inside you must seek out each of the three Reaver chieftains and put an end to them one way or another,
We must be careful with a frontal assault,
But I suspect there is little cohesion and much infighting among the Reavers,
Perhaps that can be used to our advantage?,
"As long as the Reavers hold the city and port, they will eventually starve us out",
They were able to take it because they had surprise on their side!,
And now: they rule by terror!,
"So long as we sit here, fearful and hungry, they will eventually fall upon us!",
I say we shit on that!,
I have a way into Horryn!,
Let us venture forth and attempt to free her from these savages!,
"We have men and women here, willing and able to bear arms if called upon",
"A small band of strong swords could slip in using the Fishermen’s Gate, sow chaos among the ranks of the Reavers and open the main gate from inside!",
"If this was done, I am certain we stand a chance at retaking the city!",
How would we sow chaos?,
"From what we learned, the Reavers in the city have formed splinter groups around three chieftains",
"Red Kala rules the docks, Oleg the Gray is holed up in the old Fisherman’s Lodge and someone they call ‘the Butcher’ holds his court on the steps of the temple",
"While those three mad-men still draw breath, the Reavers are still a danger",
We must put an end to them,
Either by force of arms or subterfuge,
I am certain a way may be found to pit the fools against each other,
Iben’s eyes glimmer with lust for adventure,
Or is it bloodthirst?,
So what say ye?,
Shall we make a tale worthy of the skalds?,
Let's do it!,
I'll do it but we don't need company,
That the situation is dire but not hopeless,
"By chance or design, the Fishermen’s Gate to the south-east has been opened",
My party and I were able to make it all the way to the square before we encountered reavers,
"I lost men, but we cut their band down before we retreated",
"If we move fast, we may yet be able to take advantage of the gate!",
That sounds like a trap!,
For the first time you notice the green-clad man lingering there,
He steps into the light as he takes a long drag from his pipe,
Get some food Markus,
You're no good to any of us if you starve yourself to death,
Soon enough old friend!,
"{PLAYER}, this is Iben",
He is a most useful individual and served the governor well before the calamities befell us,
Iben’s eyes sparkle and as he puffs a ring of smoke a smile plays across his face,
It is good to see I’m not the only useful individual to be found in these times,
Iben takes another pull on his pipe as he studies you,
The man’s skin is the texture of well-worn leather and his dark eyes have the keen-ness of a predator,
"More than anything, this man reminds you of some well-made tool",
Or perhaps a weapon?,
"So, what did you learn in Horryn?",
The smell of cooking food fills the camp and mixes with the sounds of cheers and blessings coming from the ragged lot of starving refugees,
You enter the makeshift office of Markus to tell him the good news and find him agitatedly pacing back and forth,
"{PLAYER}, I heard the news!",
That is amazing!,
You’ve given us a fighting chance!,
And in the Emperor’s time it seems!,
Iben here has returned from scouting the city and he comes bearing curious news,
"Iben, tell {PLAYER} what you just told me!",
The recent excitement has evidently taken more than expected out of the plump man and Markus slumps heavily into his chair,
He gestures absent-mindedly to an unlit corner of the room as he catches his breath,
That will also work!,
There is much to do here in camp to get those able to bear arms ready to storm the gate!,
I will lead them through once the signal is given and we will clasp hands over the corpses of our foes!,
Then woe to those who stand against us!,
Iben slaps Markus on the back so briskly that his hat flies off,
"As Markus recovers, he begins nervously poring over papers",
I need to begin the mustering!,
"They’ll also need supplies and arms for the civilians, and we need to prepare to receive more wounded!",
I best get to it!,
Markus dips his quill in ink and starts scribbling,
"Ask now, while you have the chance!",
Could there still be survivors in the city?,
How should we eliminate the Reaver chieftains?,
Is there a way to open the main gate?,
Iben is humming a low tune as the thoughtfully chews his empty pipe when he notices you,
Ho there {PLAYER}!,
What news?,
Shall we join forces?,
We shall indeed!,
"I dare say, great deeds lie ahead of us",
There are two gates in the city,
"The main gate to the north and one to the south, leading to the harbor",
Both are heavy portcullises and the only way to raise them is to find the nearby mechanism that operates them,
Survivors may be hiding in barricaded houses and perhaps cellars!,
"What’s more, the city has a large sewer system and if I were trapped inside with Reavers at my heels, I would certainly consider finding shelter there!",
#Chapter1Maija,
I can't say I remember seeing her,
Doesn't mean I didn't - my emporium was always busy,
"Frantzo, the camp cook, used to own the main inn - you'll find him near the stables - if anyone saw her, it'd be him",
I wish I could tell you,
Things have felt queer on Idra for a while,
Folks in Horryn started changing,
"People I'd known for years became mean, hard",
Violence and cruelty grew so common we stopped noticing it,
"Just last week, my neighbour... her children",
Maija's voice falters and her eyes begin to glisten with tears,
"A few days ago, I was out of town, taking supplies to one of the whaling vessels",
"On the way back, at sunset, I spotted a clutch of people, tearing towards us on foot from the outskirts of Horryn, covered in blood and shrieking",
My mare was so spooked that she bolted and broke her leg in the halflight,
Poor old Aga - I had to help her pass on,
"When the townsfolk reached us, they regained their senses, and told us such terrible stories",
Stories of raving madmen rampaging across the town by night,
"They...let's just say, not even children were spared",
But they didn't kill everyone - some were taken - to who knows where,
We heard screams on the wind for days afterwards,
It was clear there was no going back,
There was something else,
Hope to see you soon,
Stay safe,
The woman before you has the rugged and vital look of a life lived on the frontier,
"Though her clothes are rich and tailor-made, she wades through ankle-deep mud with rolled up sleeves, hefting heavy crates of goods off a broken cart",
Do you need help?,
Do nothing,
Greetings!,
The woman spins around as you greet her,
What's this then?,
See a lady in distress and thought you'd lend a hand did you?,
The woman snaps at you,
"By the Golden Dead, can't this bloody wait?",
It's not like I'm open for business!,
she snaps at you,
And then the poor lonely woman would owe you a debt of gratitude?,
Is that it?,
she snarls,
I'm doing this by myself or not at all!,
The woman notices you observing her,
Enjoying the show are we?,
Or are you just lame in the head?,
"In either case, come any closer and I'll have your balls!",
The woman snarls,
"Are you daft, or drunk, girl?",
Lend me a hand!,
The woman hefts the crate back onto the cart with a sigh,
"Forgive me, I'm not myself - there's not been much rest for me amid the chaos",
All this jabbering about 'the end of all mankind!',
is starting to wear on me,
"In any case, I am Maija",
I run - or ran - an emporium in Horryn,
"But you are not from Horryn, are you?",
Maija's eyes light up with suspicion,
"What brings you to Idra, hmm?",
I was heading for Horryn,
We were shipwrecked just off the coast,
A rescue mission,
"I'll ask no more, but it seems my merchant's intuition was right",
"Either way, we may yet be of help to one other",
Maija hefts the last of her crates off the damaged cart and into her makeshift tent,
And I still have a modest selection of wares with me,
My tight-fisted husband - probably still clutching at pennies when the lights went out - saved all our money in a bank on the mainland,
The damn bank dealt only with him - I need to retrieve the letters of credit to have any chance of accessing the funds,
They should still be in whatever is left of our old store,
I understand,
So?,
What's it to be?,
What have you got for sale?,
Ask about work,
What happened in Horryn?,
I must be on my way,
Maija,
Good to see you back!,
Only what I had with me when Horryn fell - but I'd be delighted to show you,
They're still the same quality goods I'm known for!,
Show me!,
#Chapter1Marsa,
You and Marsa face each other and you can help but feel a little out of place as you engage in the clapping game with the small girl,
Right,
Left,
Both,
Skip,
I don't have time for this!,
Great!,
And now?,
Keep the rythm!,
Almost there!,
Aaaand...?,
Marsa rolls her eyes,
Frogger says you're not very good at this,
"The movements are 'left, left, both, right, both, skip'!",
Let my try again!,
I guess I'm too old for games,
It's a rhyme!,
All the kids in my street play it - or at least we used to I guess,
She hesitates for a moment before proceeding with renewed vigor,
Let's try them first and then we can add the words!,
Let's try!,
You did it!,
Now let's add in the words!,
Just say them after me!,
You and Marsa proceed to repeat the pattern - this time the girl begins to recite a rhyme,
Hurry!,
He doesn't like to be alone - he's afraid of the hounds!,
Marsa,
The child is ragged and muddy and crying in great big sobs,
"As you approach, she wipes her nose and looks up at you, her eyes widening somewhat at the sight of Roland",
Hrm,
I'd prefer we just got on with our work,
Roland grunts,
"As you approach, she wipes her nose and looks up at youwith teary eyes",
What's wrong?,
Marsa looks up at you,
Did you find him?,
Did you find Froggert?,
Is this the reptilian rascal?,
Give her the stuffed animal,
I'm still looking,
Despite the squalor surrounding the girl she's now smiling from ear to ear,
Froggert is glad to be back!,
"Hey, do you want to play a game?",
Alright!,
Not right now,
leave,
Froggert!,
the girl snatches the stuffed animal from you and showers it with hugs and kisses,
"She then turns towards you, but instead of giving you a hug, she dashes past you and throws her arms around Roland's waist",
The old warrior looks startled at the sudden show of affection,
"Alright girl, you've had your frog back - there's proper work to be done now",
The girl steps back,
Froggert says thank you!,
"She then turns towards you, and throws her arms around your waist",
Glad to help!,
"Beware, beware don't dare to sleep, It brings you dreams of ebb and flow, Of churning seas and dreadful deep, And waves that lay the mountains low",
But fear the mother most of all!,
Awake before you hear her bell!,
"A thousand young will hear her call, And that was how the giants fell",
Marsa laughs,
You're getting good!,
But now Froggert says it's time to go!,
Bye!,
"The girl meanders of, chatting eagerly with her stuffed companion",
"As you turn to leave, you can't help but feel a bit uneasy at the 'children's rhyme' and you find you mind wanders off to the horror that befell the Zephyr",
You'd best be on your way,
Driina cuts in with a surprsingly harsh tone,
Girl!,
Where did you learn such superstitious bilge?,
Marsa looks up at Driina with a startled look,
I... all the children are doing it,
I thought,
Driina's face softens slightly,
I don't think it is fitting my girl,
Certainly not now. {PLAYER} let's just be on our way,
Froggert small and green and fluffy and he's my best friend and now I've LOST HIM!,
The girl looks truly heart-broken,
I'll have a look,
I CAN'T FIND FROGGERT!,
I just had him and I was playing and now he's gone and all alone somewhere!!,
Who's Froggert?,
#Chapter1RefugeeMother,
Driina touches the child’s hands and forehead and examines the child’s mouth,
This infection is beyond me,
she says in a low voice,
Drahl was right,
"If this Mother Katak does indeed have a cure, we’ll do well in paying her a visit",
We'll see what we can do,
Hannah,
"A tired-looking young woman is rocking back and forth, cradling a sick-looking child in her arms",
The child whimpers in pain as the mother tries desperately to sooth him,
Are you Hannah?,
"The woman peers up at you, her eyes wide and desperate",
What’s it to you?,
That old arse send you?,
"Well, it don’t matter now",
My Allyn’s sick,
He needs medicine,
Medicine?,
"Oh, if only I could visit mother Katak",
The women say she might be able to help my Allyn,
But Dead Emperors knows if the old woman's even still alive!,
Who is mother Katak?,
An old woman who has provided us with remedies for as long as I can remember,
"She lives in the forest deep in the islands interior, but they say it’s not safe to stray from the camp and I couldn't leave my boy in any case",
But...you could go?,
"If you tell her Hannah sent you, she'll know just what I need to cure Allyn's!",
I'll see what I can do!,
I'll do it for the right price,
"Driina, can you help this child?",
The mother clasps your hands,
The Golden Dead bless you!,
I s'pose the clerics will want the medicine for the camp but I beg this of you,
Bring a dose me’ Allyn first,
I don’t think he has long left!,
She fiddles with something around her neck,
All I have is this necklace my Petr gave me,
I'll gladly give it up to save my boy,
And I s'pose the clerics will want the medicine for the camp but I beg this of you,
I can't help you,
You've returned,
Did you find the medicine?,
The child looks healthier already and his fever appears to have broken,
Hannah smiles gratefully at you,
The mother removes the necklace from her neck,
I can give you my necklace,
"I don't know how much it's worth, but it's all I have",
I'll take it,
Keep it,
Bless the Holy Tombs!,
You don't know how much this means to me,
And little Allyn!,
Hannah gingerly feeds her child a piece of bread dipped in the foul brew,
The child offers a slight grimace at the taste but seems no worse for wear,
What about my reward?,
#IdraFarmerDead,
The corpse of Jakub and Ella,
Jakub died attempting to shield his wife with his body,
An ax is stuck in his back,
"Well, well",
The fine folk of Horryn wasted no time in meting out justice it seems,
Roland remarks,
This should have been avoided,
Driina states grimly,
It would appear the people of Horryn wasted no time in meting out justice,
He got what he deserved,
We must try to do better,
"He was a cruel man no doubt, but acts like these are the last thing we need right now",
This camp is hanging on by a thread as it is,
Driina shakes her head and sighs,
Let's just be on our way,
Acts like these are the last thing we need right now,
#IdraRefugeeCampInfermary,
The stench of disease and moans of the dying lie thick in the air of the makeshift infirmary,
An aging cleric shuffles back and forth as he tries as best he can to tend to the patients,
He exchanges a worried glance with Driina,
Drahl offers a short bow,
And you know where to find me,
Something about GoingOn,
More about GoingOn,
Finally the last part about GoingOn,
The aged cleric’s face lights up when he sees you,
Blessing of the Dead upon you!,
The gray-bearded cleric is thoughtfully wiping blood off his hands as you approach him,
"Oh forgive me, I didn’t see you there",
Are you sick?,
Fever?,
Stomach pains?,
Bloody stool?,
I don't think so,
Should I be worried?,
And upon you,
The man examines your eyes and looks in your mouth,
"No, you do in fact seem fine",
Sadly many are not so lucky,
Is it as bad as we suspected?,
Driina asks,
Drahl leans in and his voice drops to a whisper,
I fear it is worse,
Some sort of infection is spreading and so far I’ve been unable to cure it with neither spell nor concoction,
"I am, in fact, at my wit's end",
A note of desperation creeps into the old man’s voice,
Some sort of infection has broken out in the camp and so far I’ve been unable to cure it with neither spell nor concoction,
"If I can’t find a cure, this outbreak may be the death of us all!",
Though I wouldn’t know where to start,
That is,
The old man furrows his brow,
"A woman, Hannah, came to me with her boy",
Struck down by the outbreak,
She appeared a simple girl and when she pleaded with me to look for a folk remedy,
I chided her for it,
Called her foolish,
Surely Imperial medicine would prevail!,
Perhaps I was the fool?,
I wish now I had listened to her,
She left camp but I think she can be found in the little cottage south of here,
"I beg you, seek her out on my behalf and hear what she has to say!",
I suggest you seek out Hannah in her cottage south of camp,
She claimed to know of a folk-remedy,
I’m ashamed to say that this is our best chance at this point,
Drahl suspiciously accepts the potion,
He grimaces as he examines the murky liquid against the light,
These are dark days indeed when the most holy order of Sepulchites must resort to folk cures and lay medicine,
"Then again, I feel we’re left with little choice at this point",
"With Driina’s help, the two clerics go from patient to patient administring the foul brew",
Now we wait,
"The old man begins going from patient to patient, administring the foul brew",
Have you found anything?,
I have the medicine!,
What do you need my child?,
About the outbreak,
Ask about GoingOn,
The effect does not take long to manifest and within hours the patients seem to be back on their feet,
Drahl appears both relieved and pensive,
"We, you, cured them!",
I was certain their lives were forfeit and yet here they walk out on their own two legs,
Though at what price I wonder?,
"In any case, I took the time to gather some items that might serve you well in the trials that no doubt lie ahead of you",
He hands you a collection of potion-bottles,
Go now,
I’ll remain here if I am needed,
May the Dead ever watch over you,
Driina pats the old man gently on the back,
You did well my old friend,
...,
"So, what news?",
Is a cure in sight?,
About that,
No news yet but I have other questions,
"I do have a small surplus of supplies, yes",
"Also, if you're gravely wounded or suffering from disease and the like, I can assist you",
#,
# Chapter_1_Wreck,
#,
#Chapter1Leva,
Good to see ya again!,
Just glad to see I’m not the only one left alive,
Looking to barter a bit?,
Sure,
#Chapter1LostSailors,
"Hiding along the cliffs, is a lone surviving member of the Zephyr crew",
They killed them all!,
Stabbed old Nino right in the throat!,
And now you've come to finish me?!,
We need to find somewhere to hide!,
Tell the sailor about the other survivors,
Standing on the edge of the cliff is a crew-man from the Zephyr lucky enough to have made it ashore,
The man is swaying and looks in shock,
I saw it!,
"By the dead, I just saw it out there!",
The thing that sunk us!,
It's still out there!!!,
The man begins jabbering incoherently,
You're back!,
Found anyone else alive?,
Emperors watch over you for helping me find the other survivors,
You’re always welcome in our camp as far as I’m concerned!,
The man thanks you profusely and hastily makes his way towards the camp where his comrades are waiting,
#Chapter1Wreck,
"The monstrosity screeches and as it does, packs of rabid vermin spews forth from the dark recesses of the wreck!",
"You stop dead in your tracks as the grotesque rat-thing sits up on its hind legs, its hunched form a full head taller than you",
The beast cocks its head slightly and its tiny eyes regard you intently,
"Then to your utter horror, words form in its bestial throat",
It comes,
It is one!,
With fangs it comes into the womb!,
Does it come to feed?,
To give offerings?,
It?,
Are you talking about me?,
It stirs!,
Does it bring offerings?,
Or has it come to share in the meat?,
The horrid creature gouges a lump of flesh from one of the corpses and offers it to you expectantly,
Bloody filth!,
Roland spits behind you!,
What are you?,
The song woke us!,
Calls us!,
It hears it!,
Now we eat and multiply,
And serve!,
Song?,
Serve what?,
You emerge into the broken hull of the ship,
The ruined hold is unrecognizable and strewn with the debris of ruined cargo,
As your eyes adjust to the darkness you become aware of sounds emanating from the darkness,
Chittering?,
Or is it voices?,
AhhHH!!!!,
It does not serve!?,
We eats it!!!,
It rises!,
From the deep!,
Rise! it calls!,
It does not hear it?,
IT DOES NOT HEAR IT!,
#Chapter1WreckSailors,
The ragged band of survivors fan out around you like a pack of starved predators,
"Currents brought us straight ashore so if the Dead are with us, any survivors would have landed on this here shoreline",
You might want to start by searching the cliffs just to the north,
Also others are bound to have landed in the same area where you landed,
Finally there is a lighthouse to the south-east and some may have headed there,
What do you know of this island?,
I had other questions,
"If you come across any more of my men, tell them where to find me",
Both I and the guild will thank you if you do,
Snow turns his back on you and joins his men around the fire,
But you are not all to blame,
It seems our journey was doomed no matter!,
That thing!,
What was it?,
And this island,
There is something terribly wrong here!,
All I know is we need to work together if we are to survive!,
All I know is that it's each man for himself now,
The man's eyes flash from sorrow to rage in an instant,
Before you know it he draws his dagger,
What can I do for you?,
What was it that attacked the Zephyr?,
What do you know of this place?,
About the other survivors,
I found your men,
"I've been here before, years ago",
Didn't leave Horryn back then but it was nothing but a backwater port like any other,
Full of people not too fond of strangers and superstitious fishermen,
Nothing like now,
Don't you feel it?,
"Air smells strange, like right before a thunder-storm!",
And the beasts!,
"I tell you, I've sailed 'round the Empire for near on twenty years and I've never seen creatures like these!",
And then there are the men,
The men?,
We saw men stalking the fog,
Dangerous men I thought,
Then I came across some of their handy-work,
Tommyn and Dill the cabin boy,
Black arrows in their back the both of them,
Best to keep far away from them,
Where should I look for survivors?,
Your group is growing I see?,
It always is with you mercenaries,
And honest men lose their lives!,
I had not expected to see you alive mercenary!,
But you stood up for us on the Zephyr and you saved the lives of some of my men so I'm glad you made it,
Your captain was in the right so I was glad to,
Your crew didn't deserve to be slaughtered,
It was a means to an end,
"Nonetheless, it did us little good",
I've never seen anything like that beast before,
The way it tore the ship appart?,
Something is wrong here!,
What curse has befallen us?,
All I know is that we need to work together if we are to survive!,
It's each man for himself now,
Back to finish the job?,
"Well, ship's gone",
So the captain and most of my mates!,
But by the depths you won't have me without a fight!,
Snow spits at you,
Roland leans in and whispers in a low voice,
"Remember, these are guilders",
"If the guild finds them and they talk, it'll mean trouble",
Then a fight you shall have!,
Calm down lest I end you here and now!,
I'm sorry for how it turned out,
A gaunt-faced man that looks like he's spent more years at sea than ashore stands before you,
"If you recall, this was the Zephyr's first mate",
You remember his crewmates calling him 'Snow',
He glares at you with a set jaw and clenched fists,
He offers a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes as you apporach,
Greet the man,
I've never seen anything like it,
There are beasts in the depths but nothing like this!,
It was like something out of a sailors nightmare!,
"Blessed dead, how will we ever get off this island?",
There’s safety in numbers and every face from the old crew that turns up in camp here is a boon,
Especially considering how many were lost,
"In any case, I hear from the crew that you’ve been doing good work!",
"We haven’t much, but we scraped together a small bag of gold for you",
"Snow hands you a small, worn pouch of coins",
"That being said, it appears it might be too soon for celebration",
Aye - that they did,
And it cost the lives of many a good man,
"The man looks at you for a moment and his eyes begin to water from sorrow, anger and exhaustion",
Why did you do it?,
Gold?!,
She was such a fine ship!,
And us crewmen - we were like brothers!,
And now both ship and men lie broken on these cursed cliffs!,
It was just a job,
Things got out of hand,
You had it coming,
Sorry are you?,
Tell that to men who were dragged under by that leviathan!,
Tell that to the guild when they hear of this!,
Calm down man!,
You leave me no choice!,
A small group of exhausted figures sit huddled around a small campfire,
You recognize them immediately as a small group of survivors from the Zephyr,
One of them suddenly notices you and the men stumble to their feet; Some grasping for makeshift weapons and others looking around for a way to flee!,
"One of the men suddenly notices you and the men stumble to their feet, smiling at you and waving you over to their meager fire",
Approach peacefully,
Calm down?,
I say there's one of you and more of us!,
Of that I have no doubt,
"But if there is at least a shred of decency left in you, I'll beg this small favor",
"Aye, there is no disagreeing with this",
Though my men and I have naught to offer save our fire and what shelter these huts may provide,
"There are beds inside if you require, but little else",
There is one last thing,
A favor I'd ask of you,
"You may have already seen her, but a portion of the Zephyr lies upon the shore up along the coast north-west of here",
It breaks my heart to see the old girl like this,
"See, our duty to her doesn’t end with her sinking",
She’s still the property of the Guild,
As is any cargo she was carrying,
We were unable to get to her before but the tides seem to have shifted her now and I sent a small group out there to see if they couldn’t find a way into her,
And?,
Snow looks down,
That was hours ago,
Too long,
Something’s wrong or they would be back by now,
"Now, you’ve done a lot for us and I’m almost afraid to ask for more but I need to know what happened to my boyos",
Snow looks at you pleadingly,
Dead bless you,
"As I said, the wreckage lies just a few hundred yards up the coast",
Watch your back and be ready for anything,
More bloodshed,
I fear this island may be the end of us all yet,
At least the wreckage might be safe enough to explore now,
The supplies she carries may keep us going for weeks,
I’m ashamed to say I have nothing to offer you besides the promise that the Nautical Guild will not forget your service,
A lifetime under the mast is thanks enough for a Guilder isn’t it?,
Kat offers sarcastically,
Good bye,
#Chapter1WreckSpotted,
The ship is utterly shattered with its hull broken in half,
It seems impossible that the ship would have remained afloat for long enough to settle on these cliffs in its current condition,
It’s almost as if something placed it here,
"Though for what reason, you can only guess",
You spot a makeshift plank bridge leading up into the shattered hull,
"As far as you can tell there is currently no way into the ship, though that may change as it shifts in the tides",
"Laying ahead of you like some gargantuan beached sea-creature, are the smashed remains of the Zephyr",
You shudder to think of the monstrosity that caused the demise of the once-elegant ship,
What manner of terror was that creature?,
Kat muses as if reading your mind,
#Chapter1ZephyrSurvivors,
One of the wretched surviors from the Zephyr,
"The man looks torn, tattered and exhausted",
As you approach the sailor shrinks back in terror whilst avoiding your gaze,
Talk to Snow if you want something,
"As you approach the sailor offers a tired, but grateful smile",
#HoundAmbush,
A sudden sound makes you stop dead in your tracks,
Someone or something is charging towards you through the tall grass!,
A woman dressed in the livery of the nautical guild emerges from the fog!,
Panic is written on her face and she’s panting heavily!,
They’re… they’re right behind me!!,
the woman shouts excitedly,
Leva!,
What’s going on?,
Kat grabs the woman by the shoulders,
"A pack of lean, growling predators emerges from the fog",
The hounds snarl and then lunge at you!,
Bless you for saving my hide!,
I saw smoke rising from the south and was making my way there when these mongrels picked up my scent!,
I need to get going but be sure to come visit the camp - I might have some things to trade!,
The woman hurriedly jogs off towards the south,
#IdraWreckRatAmbush,
Suddenly an echoing cacophony of chittering and screeching erupts from the narrow ravines around you!,
A wave of mangy fur and snapping jaws dripping diseased mucus rolls towards you,

# Chapter_2_Horryn,
#,
#HorrynAmbush,
"As you approach the city-square, panicked cries of fear, pain and dispair echo across the plaza",
Acting quickly you quickly loosen your belt and wrap it around her leg,
"Out of the fog, coming fromthe Fisherman’s Gate, a thin wretch of a man limps into view",
"He hefts a rusty cleaver, and drags a terrified woman behind him by her auburn hair",
#HorrynGuardLedgerScene,
The boy’s jaw goes slack at first,
Then the smallest hint of resolve comes across his face,
He’s determined to face his end standing up and he lunges at you!,
The boy’s weapon lowers slightly,
I’m guarding the eastern harbor tower,
So don’t you get any ideas - This is Imperial property!,
"You know, it's pretty safe out there now",
You could just leave,
I need to get to that shelf behind you,
As you enter the chamber a pale young man in ill-fitting armor belonging to the Horryn city guard staggers backwards,
He holds his weapon before him in trembling hands,
Don’t come any closer!,
I know how to use this!,
Do you now... boy?,
Roland grumbles as he stalks into the room next to you,
Put that away before you get hurt!,
Take it easy,
I'm not going to hurt you,
"I was asked to guard this tower and by the Golden, that is what I’m going to do!!!",
His voice breaks into the falsetto of someone not quite past their teenage years,
"Roland takes a step forwards, causing the boy to let out a pathetic whimper",
"Want to die for duty, hm?",
I just want to talk a bit,
You leave me no choice,
Y-you’re not?,
Then what are you doing here?,
These records are Imperial property and I’m not letting you have them!,
Now back away!,
It's pretty safe out there now,
You can leave if you want to,
The chamberlain sends orders,
It's safe out there now and you can leave,
Lie,
About what?!,
It's pretty safe out there now!,
The young man brandishes his weapon with trembling hands,
Halt!,
I need to talk to you,
"As if to confirm your words, the shouts of the boy's comrades echo from the plaza",
A wave of relief washes over the his face,
Golden bless me!,
He pushes past you and flees into the city without looking behind,
#HorrynReaverChief1,
Oleg smiles broadly as he imitates a sawing motion with his hands,
Savage blades do bloody work,
The Whispering tablets came to me,
Begon now and do not return until you are done,
#HorrynReaverChief1GateGuard,
He had the tablets even before the Father came to us,
#HorrynReaverChief2,
My patience is running low,
I just wanted to ask some questions,
"Hmm, I see",
And when the Butcher feast’s on the old fool’s liver he’ll be so certain he’s won Father’s favor that he might not even feel my blade between his ribs,
"Blood sprays from the Butcher’s mouth as the strains from the effort and with a wet, sickening snap, Kala’s arm is torn from her body",
#HorrynReaverChief3,
"Mesmerized, he traces the grotesque carvings with fat, blood smeared fingers",
WHat now?,
#HorrynSpiral1,
#HorrynSurvivorCora,
Tell me about the reavers?,
Figthing each other?,
#HorrynSurvivorNatia,

More intro exposition,
You have formed a first impression and are ready to act,
"So, what will it be?",
Show me your wares,
I have only the finest wares!,
#HorrynChiefsDead,
"You stand dazed, surveying the carnage around you",
The three Reaver chieftains lie dead,
Now the one they call Father awaits you inside the still occupied keep,
The sound of footsteps interrupt your thoughts and you whirl around ready for another melee,
To your surprise you see the surviving soldiers of the Horryn guard bolstered by armed refugees!,
"Moving methodically from house to house, they begin the task of retaking the ravaged town",
Cries of jubilation mix with the anguished cries of people finding the corpses of former loved ones,
"Nonetheless, it does not take long for life to creep back into the desolate streets",
One of the soldiers approaches you,
"{PLAYER}, I bring word from the chamberlain!",
He’s requested you find him at the tavern over by the temple,
He asks you make haste,
The young man offers a short bow and continues on his way,
#HorrynClothierScene,
#HorrynFirgolQuestGiverScene,
A grimy woman with a haggard look on her face approaches you,
"You get the impression she would normally be quite beautiful but starvation, disease and constant fear has erased that from her features",
Perhaps for good,
"Please, they say you are looking for a way off of this island!",
I’m Julia,
"My sister, Ylia, lives in a small village called Firgol on the island north of here",
I was supposed to travel to her before this all broke out and she must be worried sick that I have not arrived yet,
She wrings her hands,
"I’m in no condition to travel now and so should your travels take you to Firgol, would you please seek out Ylia?",
Tell her that I’m still alive and not to worry?,
I’m sure they have all kinds of troubles themselves up there and I wouldn’t want her to spend time worrying about me as well,
I'll see if I can't find her,
May the Golden bless you,
I’m sure my sister can spare a few coins once you tell her the good news,
A few tears of joy leave streaks on her soot-covered face,
Hello there!,
Looking for something?,
Are you Ylia?,
Do you have a sister in Horryn?,
Why yes that’s me!,
My sister you say?,
You must mean Julia?,
I’m expecting her to visit me any day now!,
She apologies for being late but at least she’s still alive,
Tell Ylia about Horryn,
Ylia looks more surprised than horrified,
Are you sure you’re not mistaken?,
Julia is not late at all,
In fact she’s still not due until a day or two!,
And what’s this you’re saying about Horryn?,
We’ve had no news of any calamities!,
I can assure you I’m not mistaken,
"Well, I’m not sure what to say about this",
I suppose that it’s good my sister is safe if we are indeed talking about the same person,
Thank you in any case,
I was promised payment,
As the woman goes about her chores you meet Embla’s eyes,
The woman was late for her arrival two days before she even supposed to set out?,
A misunderstanding perhaps?,
Though I fear this is just another expression of the madness that grips these isles,
Ylia looks slightly taken aback,
Oh,
Yes I suppose you’re right,
I don’t have much but here are a few gold-pieces at least,
Now goodbye,
#HorrynFlopHouseScene,
A matronly woman with red cheeks and impressively bad teeth gives you a suspicious look,
You’re either looking for a bed and a bowl of stew or you ain’t got nuffin to do here!,
Let's see what you have to offer!,
#HorrynFrantzo,
You say goodbye and leave,
Have a look!,
Rooms are being cleaned and we even have warm food on the stove,
Finally the last part about Menu,
You may ask some questions!,
Show me your list of services!,
Ask about Rumors,
Something about Rumors,
More about Rumors,
Finally the last part about Rumors,
#HorrynGallian,
Driina sighs,
Truly there are many things you do not understand about this world,
It nourishes me to stand in this hall and find its altar unmolested by the madness that has engulfed this island,
"Tenderly, she touches the base of the statue and offers a whispered prayer",
Why is he masked?,
He looks so frail,
You worship a corpse,
Madness,
It symbolizes the sacrifices he made when he built the world we see around us today,
The cost of all those touched by the reticulum is indeed steep in the end,
We must never forget that,
But why is he masked?,
The elegant marble statue looms over you,
Unblemished and pristine,
"An emaciated form, dressed in ragged robes frozen mid-gesture while unmasking",
Gallian - the first Emperor - presides over the serene temple interior,
Driina reverently presses her palms lightly against her face and then removes them in a gesture reminding you of the statue,
Driina?,
The Emperors are very old,
Often several hundred years,
They are also beyond powerful - one with the Reticulum,
One can only imagine the effect it has on their physical form,
Perhaps it is best that the common folk never have to see the price of such power,
"For a moment, a shadow falls over the room - then it passes",
You must be on your way,
Nothing,
They are our Golden Dead and we must give praise that they watch over us,
Driina offers a comforting smile,
Shall we be on our way?,
Emperors don masks when they ascend to the throne,
"Being amongst the oldest and most powerful of the Magi, they are already more-than-human",
"When they don the mask, it symbolizes that they have risen beyond even their brethren",
And they are never seen without it?,
The Emperor is never seen without their mask save by the Excubitors of the Imperial Palace,
The silence hangs for a moment,
There is something unsaid,
#HorrynGuardCaptainScene,
I’m ashamed to say me and a handful of my lads ended up captured by Reavers,
They started killing us off one by one,
Real slow while the rest were forced to watch,
Or even,
Her eyes grow glassy then she shakes her head defiantly,
Then the mad-men suddenly started infighting!,
Like bloody animals!,
But at least we managed to flee,
And who are you?,
Best of luck and stay safe,
She holds up her hands in apology,
I’m sorry!,
"Without your aid, we’d all be dead",
It’s just that me and the boyos missed most of the fighting and it pains me to see we had to rely on mercenaries to keep Imperial citizens safe,
"Indeed, I don't remember seeing you on the battlefield",
"As I said, people are streaming back into town",
A lot more people than were at the refugee camp in fact!,
Isn't that a good thing?,
Yes it is,
A lot of people did what I did and hid until the terror passed,
But not this many,
Let me ask you this,
"Once a Reaver washes off the paint and blood and shit and puts regular clothing back on, is he still a Reaver?",
Are you saying Reavers are hiding amongst the regular people?,
"That’s the thing, isn’t it",
The Reavers were regular people,
Friends and neighbors,
Family even,
Most of them lie dead now or have fled Horryn,
But not all,
I think some of them just took off their rags and just went right back to being ordinary people,
Food for thought,
What did you need?,
How did you say you survived the Reavers?,
How are things going in Horryn?,
Look lively boys,
The savior of Horryn graces our halls!,
A tall woman dressed in platemail with a greatsword on her back offers a short bow,
You’re unsure if she’s being sarcastic or not,
How about some gratitude?,
"I didn't see you out there, fighting!",
"Who are you, loudmouth?",
I trust all is well?,
We hid under the docks like bloody rats,
For days we hunkered down,
Ate limpets and drank salt water,
Had no weapons and my men were all exhausted or hurt so we just stayed there,
I suppose surviving doesn’t make you a hero,
But here we are and I intend to make the most out of it,
That's all for now I guess,
She sighs,
And you are?,
Name’s Vivian Laruto,
I’m the newly minted captain of the city-guard,
It would appear the city’s stock of officers is running low indeed,
You don't sound too sure of yourself?,
Put me on the street to wrestle with thugs and drunkards any day!,
But this - being captain - is a bit of a change of pace for me,
A lot more responsibility as you can probably guess,
Especially now with the city in ruins and people streaming back in to pick up the pieces of their lives,
I can imagine,
That reminds me,
"With more people streaming in, you’ll find the streets a bit more busy",
Even more businesses are open as well now and I recommend you spend some time looking around before you continue on your travels,
At least be sure to get a hot meal and a warm bed!,
I'll do that,
Noted,
#HorrynHierophant,
The old man gives you a determined nod before producing a large key from his robes,
"Inserting it into the main door’s keyhole, he turns it with great effort until something clicks inside",
The perfectly balanced doors of the temple swing open soundlessly,
The temple’s pristine interior lies in stark contrast to the rest of the town and something about the aura of silence feels off,
Enter,
Do you have anything for sale?,
The desecrated temple stands as a sad reminder of the last days’ calamities,
Standing in front of the main gates with eyes closed in prayer is Hierophant Drahl,
As you approach you can make out a simple prayer of gratitude to the long line of deceased Emperors that now watch over the Gallian people,
"For all their savagery, it seems the mad-men were not able to breach the gates of the temple",
Drahl’s voice is a mixture of gratitude and disbelief,
He opens his eyes and looks at you for the first time,
A small miracle perhaps?,
Markus sent me,
And he could have found no better hero for what lies ahead!,
"You seek a way into the keep and in their infinite wisdom, I believe our forefathers have provided for us",
"As Markus no doubt told you, it is said that a tunnel exists between the keep and the temple",
I’ve always considered it a bit of a myth and in any case we’ve never had cause to search for it,
Until now that is,
Where do you suggest we search?,
"If the tunnel does indeed exist, I can say with absolute certainty that its entrance lies in the catacombs beneath the temple",
"In the crypts of the deepest, oldest portions would indeed be where I would place my faith",
Then that is where I will search!,
Have you found a way into the keep yet?,
As I said,
Seek out the tombs in the deepest part of the crypt!,
Blessed Dead watch over you!,
I wish to talk,
I do indeed!,
It’s not much given the circumstances but I have a selection of potions and concoctions in addition to my healing services,
#HorrynMaija,
Ask about Wares,
Ask about Something,
Something about Wares,
Something about Something,
More about Something,
Finally the last part about Something,
#HorrynOuterRetakenChamberlain,
Markus is standing by the inn’s fireplace warming his frozen fingers when he sees you,
His face lights up,
Hail {PLAYER}!,
The savior of Horryn!,
His voice breaks half way through the greeting and a coughing fit overcomes him,
I think I’ve caught a cold,
Though considering what we’ve been through I think I should count myself lucky,
"Come, join me by the fire while we talk",
"Thanks to your bravery, we’ve retaken most of Horryn and we now have access to supplies and shelter",
The refugees have been streaming back in from the camp,
They’re desperate to learn the fate of loved ones or property that was left behind,
Understandably so,
He lets out a sigh and leans in,
"However, were it not for the fact that I would have a mutiny on my hands, I would have kept them in the camp for now",
Things are much more dangerous here in Horryn than they realize,
"As far as my men report, the Reavers in the inner city seem to have been slain or driven off",
"However, the one they call… ‘Father’ still occupies the keep in the south-west corner of the harbor",
He’s barricaded himself inside with the remainder of his pack and that’s not the worst of it,
Reports are coming in that dozens of townsfolk were taken alive by the Reavers and taken to the keep,
I dread even contemplating what they are going through if they are still alive,
"We must purge Horryn of this remaining ‘infestation’ and, if the Holy Tombs will it, rescue the captives",
A frontal assault is out of the question,
The keep is well defended when held by a determined enemy and I have not the man-power to attempt it,
There is hope however,
"Hierophant Drahl, shared an ancient legend with me",
"When the current temple was constructed, a secret tunnel between it and the keep was reportedly build",
"It served the purpose of allowing the governor in the keep to escape through the temple in case of a siege or, alternatively, it made it possible for the clergy to seek shelter inside the keep if need be",
"Ironically, the tunnel was constructed centuries ago and since Horryn has seen very little warfare, it’s never been used",
"In other words, it’s very existence is… less than ensured",
Markus offers a sheepish smile,
"Nonetheless, at this time the secret tunnel is our best bet",
Hierophant Drahl is waiting for you outside the temple,
Meet him there and he’ll fill you in,
"Also, among the refugees returning were Maija and our blacksmith",
Both have opened their stores for you if you need to resupply,
And lastly {PLAYER},
Please be careful,
"I fear dangers ahead, far exceed those behind you",
May the Golden Dead lend you strength,
Talk to Hierophant Drahl at the temple,
He'll tell you about the secret entrance!,
#HorrynPilgrimLeaderScene,
There isn’t much to do!,
They say no ships are coming or going and in any case the region seems far too dangerous for us to venture into for now,
It would seem we’re stuck here for now,
That's a shame,
"A group of weather-beaten travelers, clad in ragged robes, occupy the innermost beds of the flophouse",
One of them smiles dejectedly at you,
Hello there brother,
I’m Thomas,
I lead this little troupe on our pilgrimage to the Outer Isles,
"That is, until all this madness started",
Hello there sister,
Pilgrimage?,
How did you manage to survive the reavers?,
Driina shakes her head in disapproval,
All I can say is that I promise it’s worth the toil,
You’ll feel like a new man by the end,
"Then again, if you don’t have the heart for it there’s little I can say or do to change your mind",
You’ll feel like a new woman by the end,
Hmm,
Indeed!,
We came by boat from the mainland to see the five shrines of the Outer Isles,
It’s a lesser known route and it takes you far from any inn,
That is perhaps why I feel it can be such a powerful experience,
To complete the route requires true devotion,
Not that it matters now,
It seems my comrades and I are stuck in Horryn,
What do you indend to do now?,
Aha!,
I think I've seen one of the pilgrim shrines!,
Thomas suddenly looks you over for a moment,
You have the look of a mercenary about you,
Perhaps you’d be interested in taking on the pilgrimage?,
It would fortify both your mind and your body and it would help make the sites safe for the rest of us when we’re finally able to travel again,
"Hmm, perhaps",
We have nothing to offer you as compensation but I swear that fulfilling the pilgrimage will be worth it,
"That is, if you have the stamina to see it through",
Driina grabs your elbow softly,
I really think we should listen to the man,
What exactly does it entail?,
"As I said, there are five shrines scattered throughout the Outer Isles",
"To complete the pilgrimage, you must visit each of them and spend no less than 8 hours at each site in deep meditation while you recite the Pilgrim’s Prayer",
Pilgrim’s Prayer?,
We’ll teach you the prayer before you go and note down the general directions to each of the shrines in your journal,
You should consult it before setting out,
And don’t worry,
You can complete the pilgrimage in any order!,
This all sounds like a lot of work!,
Thomas looks invigorated at the prospect of sending you off on the pilgrimage and smiles warmly at you whilst placing his hands on your shoulders,
"Brother, there is nothing more for me to say",
"If the will to complete the pilgrimage lives within you, it will be so",
"Now, be on your way and best of luck!",
Driina bows respectfully to the weatherbeaten man,
"Sister, there is nothing more for me to say",
Thomas smiles warmly at you,
You have the look of enlightenment upon you,
It gladdens my heart to see,
I pray that my comrades and I shall soon follow,
Thomas looks at you and squints slightly,
You’ve not completed the pilgrimage yet I see,
I can always tell who has and who hasn’t,
Don’t give up!,
You may have,
One of the shrines is right here on Idra!,
"Oh, I was really hoping to see them all again",
"What’s more, I had hoped to be able to bring my companions there as well",
Thomas sighs deeply,
So what do you plan to do now?,
Thomas nods towards the proprietor,
We would all be dead were it not for the lady of the house,
She hid us under the floorboards when the Reavers came and we were able to ride out the worst of it,
And you said you're pilgrims?,

# Chapter_3_HorrynCastle,

#ChamberlainCastleTaken,
No news of our missing citizens?,
I beg you make haste to Gradla,
"And if you’ve not already done so, stop by the armory before you go!",
#Chapter2HorrynCastleMainHall,
"Ahead, three figures clad in tattered robes sit bound and kneeling",
One is sobbing loudly and the second sits trembling in a puddle of his own piss,
"The third however, face covered by a hood, seems more composed - and familiar",
"Slowly, from the shadow something emerges",
Twice the size of a man yet oddly graceful the being is utterly alien in every fashion,
"You have no doubt you, at last, find yourself in the presence of ‘Father’",
"The Father-beast stalks over to the first captive, all the while breathing heavily and wheezing as if not accustomed to breathing air",
"Slowly, its four-fingered hand reaches out towards the man’s head, grasping it as easily as a grown man would grasp an apple",
"It pulls the poor wretch close and for a moment, its horrible yellow eyes seem to peer into the man’s mind",
"The creature emits a strange trilling sound and then, with terrifying ease, crushes the man’s skull like an egg",
The creature moves down the line and the process repeats,
"Once again, it gazes deeply into the eyes of the terrified prisoner almost as if it is looking for something",
Cry out,
But once again the wretch is found wanting,
"Fragments of brain and skull, spray across the hall",
Your attempt to cry out sticks in your throat,
'Father' stalks down the line to the final victim,
The beast lets out a strange trilling sound as it fixes its gaze on the third person,
"For the first time you notice that unlike the others, she’s not bound at the wrists",
With steady hands she pulls back her hood and even with all the years past you immediately recognize her,
Embla,
"As if sensing your presence, she turns her head slightly towards you",
Even in the dim light you get a feeling that she’s smiling,
Then the creature looms over her,
The creature’s eyes go wide as it reaches towards her,
"If it was searching for something, it must have found it!",
"Roaring in triumph, it lunges but at the moment of impact the room instead explodes with white light",
The heavy metallic smell of ozone mixes with the stench of burned flesh as the creature staggers backwards clutching its eyes in pain!,
Embla collapses on the floor as the surrounding cultists howl in shock and terror,
Most flee in wild panic whilst a handful instead scramble for weapons to stand in defense of their wounded master,
"The creature may have been temporarily blinded but flailing wildly in insane rage, it’s mad with rage and none the less formidable",
#HorrynCastlePrisoners,
A hush falls over the crowd,
I know her,
says the woman,
They took her in the last group,
She’s with ‘Father’ now,
I need to go but let me try picking these locks first,
Now!,
Moans and soft sobs mix with the stench of unwashed bodies and rotting corpses,
Packed densely in the castle's cells stand rows and rows of men and women,
No doubt those who were taken alive when Horryn fell,
At first they recoil in terror at the sight of you,
"Then, as they realize you’re not their cruel captors, madness overcomes them as they grasp desperately at you through the bars",
Water!,
comes the cry from parched throats,
Calm yourselves!,
I'll try to help as best I can!,
You find a bucket of water and a ladle and quickly distribute water as best you can to the desperate prisoners,
A haggard woman who looks like she’s aged a decade in the last days grabs your hand and kisses it,
The Golden Dead has sent you!,
We’ll be free soon - I can feel it in my bones!,
What's happening here?,
We were dragged from our homes!,
"When the Reavers went mad, they went from house to house",
Killing some and taking others,
It was like they knew exactly who to take and who to kill,
It was insanity,
Pure insanity!,
I’ll never forget the screams and cries,
Her hand begins to tremble,
Another woman places her arms around her in a comforting gesture and continues,
They’ve been keeping us here for days with no food and little water,
But in the last hours they’ve been coming and taking groups of three or four,
Up to see ‘Father’,
Those who go… don’t come back,
I'm looking for someone,
A woman named Embla,
To the dismay of the desperate prisoners you fail to pick the massive locks,
These people must be left to their own devices for now,
Perhaps another way of freeing them can be found ahead?,
"With great difficulty, you manage to pick the massive locks",
Slowly the exhausted prisoners exit their cells and make their way towards the secret exit,
"Whatever comes next, you have at least done some good",
#HorrynCastleQuartermaster,
An aging guard is muttering annoyed to himself as he compares the stocks of the armory with the content of a list,
As you enter the armory he’s quite unable to hide his annoyance,
"Yes, yes!",
The saviors of Horryn are to be given all possible aid - I know!,
Is there a problem here?,
Not for you,
I’m the one left sorting out this mess of a supply situation,
I’ve been ordered to assist you as best I can,
Here’s the best I can,
There should be some gear laying around that I haven’t gotten around to inventorying yet,
Take it and use it as you please,
"Secondly, I am to sell you supplies at a ’favorable’ rate",
The quartermaster shudders at the very thought,
Let's see what you have then!,
You need something?,
#HorrynCastleRetaken,
Markus smiles at you with an optimism that is utterly malplaced given the gravity of the situation,
Then it is decided!,
Aid is not long for the people of Horryn!,
"Before you go, be sure to visit the armory in the western part of the keep",
"If there is any material aid we can offer, you shall have it!",
May the Golden Dead keep their hand over you!,
Iago bow deeply,
M’lady,
"I, Iago zha Droma, shall answer your call for aid!",
You could never ask for a better ship and crew to carry us all to our dooms than my ‘Weathermaiden’,
"If indeed this is to be, there is much work to be done",
"If you will allow it, I shall return to my crew and begin preparations",
And where was that again?,
My crew is currently lying in hiding in a large cave north-west of here while the ‘Maiden’ undergoes repairs,
"In case you’ve not already been there, I shall note down the position in your journal",
Join us there when you are ready to set sail,
"Iago shakes you hand, nods to Embla and makes haste to rejoin his ship and crew",
We'll meet again soon!,
Your head reels and your body aches,
For the first time in a long while you allow yourself to acknowledge how truly exhausted you are,
"Nonetheless, a cloud appears to have lifted ever so slightly with the death of the fell creature",
It is as if the feeling of wrongness that pervades the island is diminished - though certainly not gone,
Painfully you get to your feet,
"There, in front of you lies the scion you were sent to find",
Embla of House Berryn,
Go to her,
Markus stammers as he searches for words,
"He gets up, calls for one of the guards, then changes his mind, turns around sharply and produces a piece of paper and a quill but ultimately fails to think of anything useful to do with it",
Ultimately he turns back to you and Emlba with a mask of utter dejection on his face,
Gradla,
Embla looks at the corpse of the Father for a moment then back at Markus,
"Though there is much I do not know yet, I will say this much",
Chaos engulfs the Outer Isles and the force that drives it is rising,
"For whatever reason, Gradla lies at the center of this conjunction",
"The Empire will not come for us and, though we cannot escape the outer isles, I believe a fast ship and a skilled captain could make it to the shores of Gradla",
"If we can force a landing, we may have a chance at stopping the conjuncture before the Outer Isles are lost forever",
Rescue the lost souls of Horryn and at the same time deal with this ‘conjuncture’!,
Embla says nothing,
"But if no help is coming from the mainland, we have no one to turn to but you {PLAYER}",
"Truly, we cannot ask this of you!",
I have neither men nor much equipment to offer!,
There is no doubt you speak the truth Embla,
I came here to bring you back to the mainland Embla - nothing more,
You're insane,
Embla sits up slowly,
She’s pale and sick-looking,
The raw expenditure of Reticular energy took its toll on her,
I knew it was going to be you,
It’s always you,
And I’m glad every time,
What do you mean 'every time'?,
We’ve been here before a thousand times and we’ll be here again and again until the universe itself ends,
"Slowly and unsteadily, Embla gets to her feet",
For the first time she looks you in the eyes,
A tired smile comes across her face,
"{PLAYER}, it really is good to see you",
Your father dispatched me,
You are here because you have to be,
As am I,
We always have and we always will,
"Here, on the ship… under the Priory",
She looks at you intently,
"Almost pleadingly, as if willing you to recall a memory so old it all but faded",
I don't understand?,
Suddenly a look of confusion falls over her face,
I’m sorry,
I… forgot where we were,
When we were,
"{PLAYER}, there is something so wrong here",
And much worse than you realize,
"That thing, the ‘Father’!",
The people and animals changing!,
Even… even time is wrong,
I don’t fully understand it but something is causing it,
Drawing it here,
Drawing… us here,
This isn't making sense,
Embla draws a deep breath and closes her eyes,
For a moment she is quiet,
Forgive me - I know,
I’m only beginning to understand it myself,
"For now, I’ll tell you what you",
Suddenly the heavy tramp of armored feet echo throughout the keep as the beleaguered remnants of the Horryn city guard make their way to the main hall,
"Ineptly brandishing a sword, Markus is bringing up the rear",
"The former chamberlain and now de-facto leader of Horryn looks even more thin and drawn then when you first met him but nonetheless, there is a small glimpse of triumph in his eye",
Markus!,
You’ve done it!,
We’ve,
He’s cut short as his gaze falls upon the grotesque corpse of the ‘Father’,
"By Gallian the Great, protect us all!",
How can such things exist?,
Where did it,
"He tires, and fails to fight back the nausea",
"While Markus retches in disgust, Embla meets your eyes",
It is clear that she has much to say but now is not the time or place,
Wordlessly you agree that both questions and answers will have to wait for now,
"Markus, are you okay?",
Markus slumps heavily down in a chair as he catches his breath,
He tries hard to avoid looking at the corpse sprawled on the floor,
"Once more we owe our fortunes to you, {PLAYER}",
"Sadly, the situation is dire",
So many were taken by the Reavers and there are hardly any left!,
We found but a few dozen survivors in the dungeons where there should be hundreds!,
Where have they all gone?,
Embla answers,
I’m afraid I have the answer to that,
There was a method to the Reaver’s madness,
Those they took were taken for a reason,
The ones Father approved were gathered together and placed on ships,
Markus’ face goes white,
Wh… why?,
For what possible purpose?,
I can’t tell you for what purpose but I think I know where they went at least,
North to the island of Gradla,
No doubt there is much more to Embla’s story than she’s willing to share with Markus,
Markus thinks for a moment,
There are rumors that there are smugglers held up in the sea-caves on the north-western coast,
As much as I detest smugglers it can’t be denied that they are some of the finest sailors to grace these oceans,
I would begin my search there!,
Look around!,
"Even if I agreed to follow you, there is no way to get to the mainland",
We wouldn’t even make it out of the Outer Isles before the horrors of the deep would drag us down,
"If there is a way back home, it goes through Gradla",
Then our path leads to Gradla,
Embla looks deeply into your eyes,
I have never in my life been more lucid {PLAYER},
There are events set in motion that you have not even begun to fathom,
The depth of her conviction shakes you,
I was paid to do a simple job!,
Not some suicide mission!,
I believe you,
To Gradla it is,
Embla smiles warmly,
Then it is settled,
We make for Gradla and whatever fate awaits us there,
"As for a ship and captain, the vessels here in Horryn are ruined and surely there is not a captain alive that will brave the seas at this time?",
Iago?,
"Hmm, I may have an idea",
Refer to the smugglers hiding in the sea-cave to the north-west,
Markus?,
Any suggestions?,
You explain how you found the crew of the Weathermaiden hiding in a sea-cave to the north-west of town as Markus listens intently,
I would indeed begin my search there!,
Then that is what I will do!,
#HorrynCastleSpotted,
The man laughs maniacally,
We’ll stand here again and again and again and you’ll take my hand soon enough!,
You always do,
Prisoners?,
the man asks slowly as if he doesn’t understand the question,
Then a broad smile spreads across his face,
"Oh, they’re not prisoners",
They are acolytes,
Chosen ones,
Father will weigh them and the ones he finds worthy… they go on the ships,
Such wonders they will see,
The man’s tone is dream-like,
Die scum!,
Take me to him,
The small band of Reavers stand swaying in the halflight of the dimly lit room,
They look pale and drawn and their eyes distant,
"It strikes you that, in their fervor, they have likely neither eaten or slept in the last days of chaos",
These men are being driven beyond their limit,
"By what, you don’t dare speculate",
"One of them blinks a few times as he notices you, and an oddly beatific smile falls over his face as their lethargy is replaced by the prowling aspect of some predator",
You immediately recognize the man as the leader of the first Reaver band you came across when you entered Horryn,
You came,
His voice is hoarse and dry and there is a genuine note of gratitude in it,
"He’s waiting, you know",
It’s your turn now to go to Father,
Let me take you,
He offers you a shaking hand,
Take me to Father,
What are you doing to the prisoners?,
I'm here to put you down!,
The band flocks around you and swiftly leads you through the ravaged halls of the keep,
"Cries of terror echo faintly ahead and though you are no doubt being driven towards their source, you cannot help but feel… a calling",
You must go this way,
You always have and you will do so a thousand times again,
You arrive at your destination,
The keep’s great hall,
"Robed figures line the walls, bathed in the lambent light of foul sorcery",
Go,
someone whispers,
He’s ready for you,

I understand but consider this my friend,
There are many who can swing a sword as well as me but there is only one who can captain a vessel like me,
And I suspect it will take all my skill to get us off this island when the time is right,
Go be with your crew,
It is hard to say how soon we can be ready to sail again,
I’ll know more once I’ve talked to my crew,
"Come find me later, on the deck of the ‘Maiden’ and I shall give you my best estimate",
Farewell for now my friend!,
Iago bows deeply,
Iago bows deeply and kisses your hand,
We'll see eachother again soon,
Iago stops and regards the Weathermaiden with a sad smile,
"Out of all of them, she is my only true love",
he whispers almost to himself,
"{PLAYER}, my friend, there is work here to be done and I must be with my crew",
Do you think we are ready to sail soon?,
I could use you at my side a bit longer Iago!,
I’ll go ahead and talk to my crew,
"Please, enjoy our hospitality such as it is and come find me on the ‘maiden’ when you are ready",
"As Iago rejoins his crew, a great cheer goes up from the host gathering excitedly around him",
You can faintly make out how he regales them with the tales of his daring escape from the dungeons of the cruel Rat Queen,
You can’t help but become infected by the crew’s excitement,
"Though great danger no doubt lies ahead, it appears you will finally be able to get off this island soon",
Though there is still bloody work waiting for you inside Horryn’s walls you have no doubt made an important ally here today,
Perhaps the Weathermaiden and her crew will indeed provide a way off this island sometime in the near future?,
#IagoQuartermasterScene,
Farewell and adieu!,
Let me know if you change your mind,
I’ll be here,
We were headed for the mainland fully laden when we became stranded here,
I have crates and crates of food but I risk having it rot on me if we don’t get out of here soon,
He gestures to a large pile of crates nearby,
There is a famine crisis brewing in the refugee camp,
The quartermaster strokes his chin thoughtfully,
"Look, I’d be happy to help if I could but this here cargo is not mine to give",
We carry it - we don’t own it,
At the very least you’d have to pay me for it,
I’d say 500 gold pieces would get you enough to feed your people for weeks,
I'll pay!,
That's a lot of money,
Made a decision yet?,
I'll pay the,
Good to hear!,
So you have the 500 gold?,
You have {ITEM} gold pieces,
Here you go!,
I changed my mind,
"For that long and riveting tale, I’ll refer you to our illustrious first mate, Zhara",
She should be down by the ship!,
Alright,
One more thing,
Right then!,
Fresh swab-monkeys I see!,
Just pulling your leg,
I’m Anto,
Quartermaster of this here fine ship,
You looking for something?,
I might have a few odds and ends to sell off now that we’re stuck here!,
I was wondering,
That might be so but it really is the best I can do for you,
Show me what you have for sale!,
You seem to have a lot of food supplies,
How did you end up in this cave?,
About the food supplies,
Ho there landlubber!,
Back for more?,
Let's talk!,
Wonderful!,
Tell you what,
"Since I feel bad for taking your gold, I’ll have some of my boyos help you lug the supplies back to camp",
"In fact, you go ahead and return to the refugees with the good news and by the time you get there, the food will be right behind you!",
The quartermaster begins organizing a work-party,
You should return to Frantzo with the good news,
#IagoSeaCave,
Iago offers a curteous bow,
Iago kisses your hand and offers a sultry look,
"Please, do not tarry too long",
"Iago is thoughtfully pacing the deck of the Weathermaiden, securing cargo and tightening knots",
The banality of the tasks appear contrary to his flamboyant personality but speaks of a deep love for the vessel,
You look grand!,
The ‘maiden’ is ship-shape and we are ready to sail at your command!,
My poor ship on the other hand,
She won’t sail for a while yet,
Let's talk for a bit,
Then let's set sail!,
Hm?,
How long until we are ready to sail?,
Let's set sail!,
It’s hard to say,
My men are hard at work but the damage was severe and it may take quite some time yet,
"Besides, you still have work in Horryn no?",
I feel confident that the Blind Maiden will have us sailing by the time you finish your bold quest,
That seems convenient,
It is how the Blind Maiden throws her bones,
I best get going then,
Salutations!,
I apologize if I appear a bit preoccupied,
There is much work to be done!,
Salutations {PLAYER}!,
The ‘maiden’ is ready when you are!,
I'll be back!,
Music to my ears!,
We are ready when you are,
Just know that you must finish your business here in the sea-caves before we go,
Leave no belonging behind or errand undone,
My men and I will block off the land-entrance to hide the sanctuary from would-be intruders and Imperial scum,
I'm ready!,
"On second thought, I have something I need to do first!",
Then I shall give the order!,
My crew and I will maneuver the ‘maiden’ out and into open waters and await you there,
"Board when you are ready and, though we may be sailing towards our doom we are certainly sailing towards great adventure",
The Weathermaiden is expertly guided out of the sea-cave and now lies at anchor awaiting your arrival,

"A tall, muscular woman, beautiful but for a scar across the cheek, stands looking over papers whilst apparently counting under her breath",
Her flamboyant outfit marks her not only as a southerner but likely also an officer,
So it's you we have to thank for our captain's return?,
"Well, the Weathermaiden is in your gratitude",
She grins revealing a golden tooth,
I’m at your service - but if it’s all the same to you I have much to do,
#ZharaScene,
Be careful out there!,
He is the finest sea-captain from here to the Sea-Gates,
If you’ve not heard of him it is because he prefers it so,
Such is the nature of our vocation,
Vocation?,
"As I said, our cargo is often less than legal",
There is trouble brewing in the Freymark and plenty of people looking to acquire goods outside the Imperial trade network,
We carry it and people like the Rat Queen sell it,
Ah - I see sell-swords have come to answer the maiden’s plea!,
"Her smile however, does not quite reach her eyes",
We met your man Dono in the refugee camp,
I am Zhara,
First mate of the illustrious Weathermaiden,
She gestures grandly to the anchored ship,
As she proceeds a shadow falls over her face,
We were on our way to the mainland when we encountered… something ancient,
We lost many a good man and the ship was gravely damaged,
"However, by the grace of the Blind and our captain's good fortune, we outran the beast and made it to the shallows",
It did not pursue us there and we suspect it will not stray too far from deeper waters,
"Thankfully, we were close to the sea-cave and we’ve been holed up here since",
The Behemoth,
It sunk our ship as well as we attempted to land,
Behemoth indeed,
What a strange fate that we should both be survivors of something so deadly,
In our case we made as good an escape as can be had against such a horror,
"The ‘Maiden’ is fast but more so, our captain, Iago zha Droma, is the finest captain to sail these waters",
Be their sails black or white,
And where is your Captain now?,
That is where I hope you might be of assistance,
"While we await repairs, our cargo is rotting in our holds",
The Captain decided to venture into Horryn and seek out the Rat Queen and her black market in a bid to offload what he could,
I advised him against it as the ‘Queen’ is cruel and fickle,
Black market?,
"As you may have surmised, our operation is less than sanctioned by the Empire",
"We must ply our trade in the shadows and we deal with those we can, I suppose",
"In any case, you no doubt know as well as I what has befallen this island",
Horryn is overrun by mad-men and I fear that the Captain was still inside its walls when the city fell,
In any case we have not seen him for days and I fear the worst,
A slight hint of desperation creeps into her voice,
And now you want me to look for him?,
"If you can make it inside the walls, you would be doing a favor to the finest captain in the Outer Isles if you could venture to rescue him",
Surely that must be worth something?,
I'll keep an eye out for him,
Zhara looks relieved,
That is all I ask!,
I would begin the search at the Rat Queen’s court,
I’ve never seen it myself but I hear it lies deep in the sewers under the city,
Just be careful and trust no one - least of all the Rat Queen,
Zhara spits in contempt,
Where did you say I should look for Iago?,
Tell me more about your Captain,
How long until you can take to sea again?,
The ‘maiden’ took quite a beating and we’ll be here for quite some time yet,
"And in any case, we’re not leaving until we learn Iago’s fate",
"That being said, monster or no monster, we’re not staying a moment more than we need on this accursed island",
There is something… wrong here,
I feel it in my bones,
Do you think you can outrun the creature again?,
"If there is one captain and one ship that could, it's Iago at the helm of the ‘Maiden’",
We may need to be cautious and stay close to shore but I’m willing to roll those dice,
The Blind has her hand over us,
What news of Captain Iago?,
"As I said, he made his way towards the black markets that lie under Horryn",
All I know is that they can be entered via the sewers that lie under the city,
"Though the black market is no doubt a nest of vipers, I fear the biggest problem for now is finding a way into the city itself",
Perhaps allying yourself with the survivors in the refugee camp is a wise course of action?,

# Chapter_4_AdlersHelm,
#,
#AdlersHelmBossScene,
Thank you for all your help so far,
Be sure to talk to Doron and Arra before you go,
I’m sure they’ll help you in any way they can,
It all began when we found the stairs leading up to the plateau in the mines,
Stairs like you’ve never seen before; Cut right into the mountain itself and going straight up,
Stairs you say?,
We climbed them and found they made it possible to reach the plateau above us,
"If I were to guess, I’d say we were the first to set foot up there for hundreds, or even thousands of years!",
And that’s saying something about the age of the stairs,
What happened then?,
I dispatched a small party up onto the plateau to look around a bit but we’re not really equipped for exploration,
So we did what the company would expect,
Send a report to the mainland and return to normal operations,
So you found something up on the plateau?,
Aye we did,
The team reported seeing buildings up there in the ice,
Old but Imperial from what they could tell,
Which is strange because the company has as good maps as any of Gradla and nowhere are there records of Imperial structures,
Least of all up on that Magi-forsaken plateau!,
And did the company respond to the reports?,
That’s the strange part,
The response came almost immediately - Almost as if the company was expecting the find or something,
We were to make ready to receive an expedition that was to explore the plateau,
"Until then, we were told to keep quiet about the find and stay away from the plateau",
They even closed down mining operations!,
I’ve never heard of anything remotely similar happening before,
So what happened?,
Expedition arrived by ship in no time and set off the next day up onto the plateau,
That’s the last we saw of them,
"Whatever they found up there, I know in my bones it’s what caused the madness that’s been gripping Adler’s Helm",
Embla shoots you a knowing glance,
We need to get going,
You… you did it?,
"Your eyes, there’s something about them",
I’d say you’ve seen things no man or woman should ever have to!,
"I don’t want to know what you faced down there in the dark, but tell me this",
What of my crew?,
Are they gone?,
There's no one else coming out of those mines alive,
Lorn trembles and his eyes water up,
"The man has lived through horrors untold, hiding for days and days like an animal to stay alive",
You feel bad you weren’t at least able to bring him better news,
They were good men and women,
The Golden Dead will protect them now,
I want to know what happened here!,
Something about Plateau,
More about Plateau,
Finally the last part about Plateau,
Something about Priory,
More about Priory,
Finally the last part about Priory,
Whatever you need,
Tell me again what happened here?,
Ask about Plateau,
Ask about Priory,
#AdlersHelmMerchantScene,
I think it’s safe to say you’ve saved our lives,
Or at least prolonged them!,
"Say, would you be in need of supplies?",
I was pretty well stocked when things went bad and the least I can do is trade with you at a reasonable rate,
Sure!,
Let's trade!,
Looking to trade?,
#AdlersHelmPilotScene,
I’ll be waiting for you right here whenever you’re ready!,
You set out from Adler’s Helm by one of the surviving light boats and Doran expertly guides you through the narrow straits,
In no time you find yourself back on the shores which you landed,
With Doran joining the crew of the Weathermaiden it should now be possible to sail all the way directly to Adler’s Helm,
An exhausted-looking young man smiles and bows as you approach,
"Emperor’s bones, it will be good to get out of here",
"Say, did you come here by ship?",
Yes but we had to land on the southern shores,
I see!,
"Well, Doran’s my name and the company hired me on as a pilot",
I sail with ships making the passing up the bay towards Adler’s to help them navigate the underwater rocks and reefs,
Could you do that for us as well?,
That I could indeed!,
"We could travel together to where your ship is, then I’ll stay on and help your captain navigate to and from Adler’s all safe and sound",
It’s the least I could do to thank you!,
I’m ready to go when you are,
We’ll take one of the light boats and I’ll get us down to the southern shore and your ship in no time,
Not yet!,
I have some things to do first,
Doran looks at you expectantly,
Being holed up like this isn’t for me!,
#GradlaMinesAmbush1,
You enter a larger chamber and are struck by the temperature of the air,
It appears to be getting unnaturally warm the deeper you venture into the mines,
"Suddenly, the shifting of stones captures your attention and you become aware of large eyes regarding you from the darkness",
"As you take an apprehensive step backwards, the horrors step into the dimness of the chamber",
"The hulking horrors from the deep, move with deadly grace as they slowly fan out in an attempt to encircle you",
Suddenly one of them lunges - Its arms outstretched and fingers splayed!,
Are they trying to take you alive?,
Charge!,
#GradlaMinesAmbush2,
"As you enter the room you walk into a wall of warm, damp air",
The stifling atmosphere causes your clothing to stick to your body and your head goes light,
You try to push ahead but halt once again as stars flash before your eyes and a ringing rises in your ears,
Embla squints into the darkness,
We are getting close,
A presence,
Ancient,
Powerful,
Suddenly Embla cries out in pain as she sinks to her knees,
"As you rush to aid her, a horrid clicking noise sounds from the darkness",
"Embla, get up!",
Hulking shapes emerge from the darkened tunnels around you,
One of them steps into the dim circle of light,
"It regards you with huge, yellow eyes full of alien intellect",
"To your horror, organs never meant for human speech croak forth words",
More vesselsss come to usssss!,
Sheee will be pleasssssed!,
Die you foul beasts!,
#GradlaMinesMainChamber,
"You take a step toward the massive creature and as she rears up and bellows, the utter futility of attempting to fight her dawns on you!",
Flee,
Your pathetic attempt at bravery comes to a sudden and terrible end as you are torn limb from limb by the ancient and terrible creature,
Your quest has ended,
You spin on your heel and flee the breeding chamber as fast as you can,
It is too late however,
The Queen’s ire is up and with surprising grace and agility the ancient beast gives chase through the narrow tunnels of the mine,
Make for the exit,
Turn and charge at her instead,
Run towards the trapped tunnel,
"Sprinting blindly through the winding tunnels, panic takes you",
There is no way to outrun this creature and nowhere to hide,
"Relentlessly, the ancient Queen chases you down and tears you limb from limb",
"Looming menacingly above you, the Queen positions herself between you and her cocooned ‘vessels’",
"You can’t help but notice that beyond her, to the north, is another chamber where you can barely make out what appears to be a robed figure",
Attack the Queen,
Carefully sneak away,
You emerge into a large natural cave,
The atmosphere here is tropical and strange writhing growths cover the walls,
"Slowly, you make your way towards one of the nodules and become aware of a strange wheezing sound",
Could it be… breathing?,
"As light falls on the first of the cocoons you realize, to your horror, that you’ve found the lost citizens of Horryn",
You carefully lean in to examine one of the hapless victims but nearly cry out in alarm when the poor man opens his eyes,
He moans and looks around with confused swimming eyes,
"As he fixes on you, his mouth moves as if to speak",
Slowly and painfully two words escape him,
Kill me,
"At that very moment, the low growl of a massive creature reverberates through the tunnels",
She’s here,
Embla whispers in a tone half reverence and half terror,
The ground shakes as the huge beast slowly moves towards you,
What was first mercifully obscured by darkness now comes into view,
"Standing more than twice as tall as the Deep-Ones you have battled before, this creature is enormous and no doubt lethal beyond compare",
"Now revealed in all her glory, it becomes clear to you",
She is a queen-mother and you are standing in her breeding chamber,
"You reemerge into the horrid breeding-chamber, and once again the giant Queen emerges from the darkness",
You hold your breath in terror as you carefully take a step backwards,
The beast-queen watches you intently but it seems you are in luck,
The instinct to remain with her brood is stronger than the instinct to kill,
"Realizing you can never outrun her, you have but one chance",
The trapped tunnel!,
The creature is nearly at your heels as you round the last corner and spot the trigger-rope,
"Your lungs are on fire from breathing the thick, dust-laden air and with a final spasm of effort you lunge for the rope",
Pull the rope!,
And catch it as you slide along the floor,
The beam snaps like a twig and instantly gravity asserts its dominance over rock!,
"Countless tons crash down in an instant, utterly turning the body of the gargantuan abomination into so much gore",
Falling rocks pummel you and then a huge billowing cloud of choking dust fills the remaining tunnel,
Couching madly and stumbling about in the dark you nonetheless manage to get your bearings,
"Slowly, you make your way to the exit and into fresh air",
For now you must recover from the ordeal and wait for the dust to settle,
#GradlaMinesSpottedExit,
I’m not sure,
I suspect the Deep-Ones never made it to the plateau,
"They are creatures of the sea and though they are dangerous enough on land, their reach is limited",
Perhaps that is why they were breeding with humans?,
To make hybrids?,
What other dangers could be waiting for us then?,
Embla’s voice drops to a whisper,
The seven eyes of the Dragon are fixed on the Priory,
I can feel it,
"It writhes in the void, coveting that which lies below the Priory",
Its tendrils are grasping!,
Your head spins and for an instance you again imagine hearing the chanting of some long dead language in the darkness,
Let's not speak of such things here in the darkness,
Let’s move on,
The statues of two robed figures loom ominously over a doorway carved directly into the mountain with uncanny precision,
"Beyond, a narrow stair with oddly proportioned steps ascends steeply",
The faintest of wisps of cool mountain air can be felt coming down through the shaft,
These stairs are not part of the mines,
says Embla as she stares up at the statues in reverence,
They were built by those who built the Priory,
So they lead up to the plateau?,
"Yes, I believe they do",
"Once we ascend, we’ll be within striking distance of the Priory",
"For all we have faced so far, I suspect there is yet much danger ahead",
"In other words, we must be well prepared before we set out",
Danger?,
From the Deep-Ones?,
#GradlaTownEnter,
Something about DeepOnes,
More about DeepOnes,
Finally the last part about DeepOnes,
I need to be on my way,
We’ll stay here and for now you can bloody well find your own place to hide,
Come back once it’s safe and we’ll see if we can’t scrounge up some supplies and a warm bed for you,
Also,
Be careful and don’t lead those bloody things here if things go bad!,
World's gone mad!,
All began with us finding those odd stairs leading up to the plateau with those strange ruins,
The Company sent an expedition here to investigate it and all,
They set off up onto the plateau and then - nothing,
That is until the ‘events’ started!,
Events?,
Started with my crew getting these strange dreams,
Then we saw lights dance up over the plateau and heard strange sounds,
Howls almost,
Then came the ‘things’ from the sea,
The man’s voice shakes with terror,
What 'things'?,
Things that should not be,
Scaled things that walk like men,
They fell upon us in the night and we didn’t stand a chance,
"I’m not ashamed to say, the only reason I’m still alive is I hid like a frightened child",
Emperor’s bones I even pissed myself,
"Strange thing is, it seems the monster tried to drag people away alive if they could",
Dragged them right into the mines if you can believe it,
There were screams at first,
Such horrible screams,
But they stopped soon enough,
We almost thought they’d left and that we could make a run for it!,
Then the ships started arriving,
Mad-men sailing all manners of vessels!,
Was like they didn’t even try to land properly,
They just beached the ships or ran them onto the reef but that didn’t matter,
The sea-creatures emerged from the mine to claim the offerings the madmen had brought,
Fresh captives,
What happened to the captives?,
"The madmen chanted as the captives were dragged into the mine, same as my crew",
We heard them scream as well,
I shudder to think what’s going on down there in the darkness,
What can you tell me about the mines?,
As you enter the mining camp you are greeted by the sight of carnage,
Dead horses and animals litter the small plaza and the only visible sign of life is a lone dog,
We’ve seen this before,
Embla looks around thoughtfully,
"You saw the wrecked ships as we came in, right?",
At least some of them came from Horryn and that means there may at least be Reavers about,
Pst!,
Hey you!,
a voice whispers loudly from the nearby building,
By the Golden!,
Company’s mounted a rescue!,
A wild-eyed man is peering at you through a slit in the door,
What company?,
The… the Gildendelve Mining Charter!,
Do you mean to say the company didn’t send you?!,
"Well, aren’t we all fucked then",
"Big Lorn, they called me",
I’m the foreman here at the mines,
"Or, I used to be is more like it",
Crew’s all dead or taken into the mines!,
Me and a handful of others have been hiding here for days but all the rest are gone!,
"And begging your pardon, we’re staying right where we are until help arrives!",
"What, you won't let me in?",
I shouldn’t even be talking to you!,
It’ll draw them here and they’ll drag us into the mines as well!,
We’re not coming out until it’s safe and that’s that!,
The man begins to slide shut the hatch in the door,
I need more information!,
Ore mines,
It’s an older mine that the Company reclaimed,
We were expanding the western tunnels when we broke into an older part of the cave,
That’s where we found the stairs,
Stairs?,
"Listen, I don’t want to talk anymore about this right now",
"We found the stairs, Company sent their expedition up onto the plateau and whatever they found, things went to shit!",
Kill those things in the mine and I’ll be a lot more talkative,
I'd best get going then,
"Well, be quick about it!",
They could be back any time!,
What's happened here?,
Who are 'they'?,
The hatch in the door slides open and a pair of haggard eyes stare out apprehensively,
You’re still alive?,
Is it safe to come out?,
Not yet but I need to talk!,
#MineExit,
You stand at the foot of the stairs for a moment,
It’s as if something is holding you back,
"If you take even the first step, events will be set in motion that can never be undone",
Then the strangest thought strikes you,
You’ve always been climbing these stairs and you will keep climbing them until the universe ends,
Take the first step,
The morbid thought is soon dispelled by the endless monotony of the climb,
The shaft goes straight forwards and up at a steep angle,
There is no bend or curve,
Just the same infinitely ascending stairs perfectly carved through the heart of the mountain,
"For the longest time, the only change is the drop in temperature as you get higher",
"Then, finally you catch the first glimpse of natural light in a long time",
The exit is in sight!,
The exhilaration fills you with energy and rejuvenates your aching thighs,
"With a final exertion, you make it to the top and emerge onto the barren plains of the interior plateau",
The Black Priory awaits you,
#MineFaultyBeam,
The support-beam appears to be close to giving in,
"It seems that if this beam breaks, this whole section of tunnel will collapse",
"If you have some rope, you might be able to take advantage of this to rig a trap of sorts",
Use rope to rig trap,
A makeshift trap,
"If you had a reason to do so, you could cause this section of tunnel to collapse - crushing anyone inside under tons of rock",
"You carefully tie the rope around the beam in such a way that if you give it a good tug, the beam will cause the tunnel ahead to collapse",
#MineSecretDoor,
This section of wall appears to be close to collapsing,
If you have a pick-axe you could likely break through to the other side,
Use pick-axe!,
You make short work of the wall and in no time it collapses to reveal that you have just linked up to the mine entrance,
This will no doubt serve as a handy short-cut should you have the need to return to Adler’s Helm,
#,
# Chapter_4_Embla,
#,
#EmblaExplains1,
Heresy,
There are powerful men who would burn us alive at the very mention of it,
"They have known about it for a long time, the courts of the Magi",
It is the nightmare they want to close their eyes and pretend doesn’t exist,
Not here,
We’ve already lingered for too long and I've said too much,
We better move on for now and talk more once we leave Idra behind,
"As mankind has ever ruled the land, there are far older and more sinister things that rule the depths of the ocean",
Ancient things with utterly alien minds,
"The Deep-Ones are drawn here, like flies to carrion, and now they too have their terrible eyes fixed on Gradla",
Is that why the Reavers were sending people to Gradla?,
The Reavers serve the gods that their ancestors worshiped here in the Outer Isles,
A faith that had lain dormant for millennia,
"As the conjunction approached, they were reminded of old allegiances and old, terrible ways",
Conjunction?,
What does that mean?,
Embla smiles,
I promise there will be time for more questions once we are safe,
"For now, I’m truly happy it’s you by my side here at the edge of madness",
"Now, let’s finish gathering supplies and then make our way to Iago",
"Time unfortunately, is working against us",
"Now, we must make haste in finding a ship and crew to bear us to Gradla",
And you ventured forth,
Lord Cato offered me a substantial amount of money to rescue you,
That is all,
"You know as well as I, my family has a debt of honor to yours",
I’ve known you since we were small children,
How could I not come?,
"I’m sure that if we make it back, my dear father will indeed drown you in gold",
"For now, some answers will do!",
Embla’s face becomes severe,
"Your family is tied to mine but believe me when I say, it is not by duty",
There are forces at work here that I’m only beginning to understand,
You have to give me something!,
I appreciate that old friend,
"Nonetheless, I would say we are always going to end up standing here",
We have before and we will again,
There you go again!,
What does that even mean?,
I need some answers,
"Unceremoniously, Embla sets off at a brisk pace",
We should venture to be as well prepared as possible before leaving Idra,
"Any supplies we need, now is the time to get them",
A bizarre thought crosses your mind,
It’s like she’s an actor playing out a scene she’s performed a hundred times before,
We need to put all our effort into finding a captain that will take us off the island,
Markus talked about the sea-cave on the island’s north-western coastline,
"What, no 'thank-you'?",
"Embla, stop!",
I'm not leaving until I get some answers,
And we have much to talk about,
Though I may have fewer answers than you would have preferred,
"Worse yet, I fear what answers I do have, you will wish you had never gotten",
Embla looks around,
Her voice drops,
"Sadly, we are much less safe here in Horryn than Markus would like to believe",
I’ll answer what I can now but most things should wait until we are far away from here,
Are you still afraid of the Reavers?,
Them least of all,
But there are other forces far older and more powerful than the Reavers with their eyes fixed on the Outer Isles,
Let’s just be careful,
Embla turns around and blinks,
For a moment it’s almost as if she’s seeing you for the first time,
My mind is a bit scattered these days,
Your resourcefulness in finding me never ceases to amaze me,
Then again it’s always been that way,
She offers a tired smile,
Day-dreamer,
Star-Child,
I’ve no time for sentimental dribble!,
I want answers!,
Lord Cato summoned me,
Told me you were missing,
Without you I would be left in the darkness of the keep to suffer an infinite number of gruesome fates,
Over and over,
You’re the only one who can find me and drag me back into the light,
It has to be you - and for that I am glad… ‘Day-Dreamer’,
I don’t understand! ‘Infinite’?,
Reality itself is becoming undone around us,
We cannot escape it so instead we must seek the eye of the storm,
There is something there that beckons,
Embla interrupts herself and looks around suspiciously,
And that 'Father' thing?,
Terror stalks the seas around Idra and I suspect you have seen it as well,
I believe a fast ship and a skilled captain can allow us to move around within the Outer Isles but there is no way for us to brave the high seas and reach the mainland,
What’s more,
Embla looks towards the sky,
Stars aren’t right,
Embla mumbles almost to herself,
I’m not even sure it would be possible to reach,
She shakes her head as if clearing out unwelcome thoughts,
The point is moot,
We must reach Gradla or perish trying,
What is happening here?,
I don't understand it!,
Then let's get going,
"So, ask what you will but mind your surroundings",
What’s really going on here Embla?,
We should just find a ship and make for the mainland!,
Let's just get going,
You remembered,
"Then again, this is like those times back at my father’s villa",
You chasing me through the maze,
Her face darkens,
"At least then, we always knew what lay at the center",
I have so many questions,
#IdraOpenWaters,
The rise of the Cabal is the surest sign that the power of the Magi-Emperors is waning,
"Even a decade ago, such consolidation of power into lay-hands would be unthinkable",
The Cabal is shrouded in secrecy and will go to any lengths to keep it that way,
What few rumors I have heard claim that certain lay-nobles and freelenders are prominent amongst their ranks,
Men and women of great wealth and even greater ambition,
"I cannot tell you what their ultimate design is, but these people are no amatuers to power",
They no doubt realize what lies beneath the Priory and the impact its recovery will have on the course of the Empire,
"I also believe that if they were to achieve their end-goal, it would spell disaster for us all",
Enough for today,
We'll talk again later,
Embla sighs and picks her nails thoughtfully,
"The corpse buried underneath the Priory, it… it calls out to me",
I cannot tell you exactly when it began but the beckoning intensified greatly once the tomb seals were broken,
Now it’s almost unbearable and… it’s growing stronger by the day,
But why you?,
There are things I’m not ready to talk about,
Things from my past - from when we were young together,
What I will say is that I sense certain things,
Things that are hidden to most other people,
"Some Magi see them too but I think that, unlike them, I was born with the ability",
I believe this is why the corpse calls out to me,
I'm not sure I understand,
"To be honest, I’m not sure I understand it myself",
What I do know is that the calling I feel is real,
Reaching the Priory before the region succumbs to the conjunction is critical,
"In fact, I fear the survival of the entire Empire hangs on it",
I know this and so did the Cabal,
Tell me more about the Cabal!,
"When powerful magi pass, their corpses retain much of their reticular attunement",
"Emperors are amongst the most powerful of all magi and needless to say, their corpses are a source of great power",
It’s not without reason the Imperial Corpses of the Eternity Vale are guarded for so jealously by the Sepulchites,
But an Emperor?,
Buried on Gradla?,
"It sounds incredible, but as I said before, there are corpses from the earlier dynasties that have been lost to history",
There were Emperors that were proscribed by the Magi,
It may indeed be the corpse of one of these ‘forgotten’ Emperors that has been found on Gradla,
But there’s more,
I'm almost afraid to ask,
Latter day Emperors are but a shadow of the rulers of old in terms of power,
"If this is truly an Emperor of the Primarian Dynasty, and it has lain undisturbed for all these millennia, the power contained within it will be immense",
Enough to remake the Empire itself - or topple it utterly,
Powerful enough to rend reality itself?,
So it seems,
My belief is that the conjuncture is caused directly by the discovery of the holy corpse,
Its raw power has drawn the attention of ‘that which lingers in darkness’ and now its tentacles are slowly closing in around us,
For a moment you think you hear crude chanting in the darkness,
It must have been the wind,
How do you fit into all of this?,
Embla leans back and massages her temples,
I’m here for you when you need to talk but I agree,
Let’s say it’s enough for today,
She stands up slowly,
I’m going to go lie down,
Ship-travel does not agree with me,
The ship is alive with nervous energy as the crew scuttles back like pieces of some well-crafted machinery,
"Though your journey is bound to be fraught with danger, there is little doubt that being back at sea has done the crew well",
Not for the monastery itself,
But what was said to lie underneath it,
Embla grasps your wrist and leans in while her voice drops ever so slightly,
The monks built the Priory to guard something,
A grave,
An ancient tomb from the earliest days of the Empire,
"And if the Priory’s existence was truly lost to history, it means that at some point, the very Empire itself must have aided in the conspiracy of silence",
But who could be buried there to warrant such extreme measures?,
"I cannot tell you exactly how I know this, but I have not a single shred of doubt",
What lies buried under that priory is the corpse of a Magos-Emperor,
"Not only that, but it must be one of the first and oldest of the line",
That can't be!,
It can and it is!,
Not all of the corpses of the first Emperors can be accounted for and interment in the Eternity Vale did not begin until centuries after Gallian’s Ascension,
The Cabal knew it to be true and as do I,
Their expedition arrived at the island of Gradla a few months ago,
I suspect they breached the tombs underneath the temple a few weeks later,
"Whatever they found there, its reticular reverberations were powerful enough to throw all of the Outer Isles into madness",
And now we're sailing into the heart of madness?,
Embla smiles weakly,
He’s calling out to me,
I feel it in every ounce of my being,
"Unfortunately, I’m not the only one to hear the call",
"Like sharks drawn to blood in the water, ‘other’ things are drawn to it as well",
Things from outside,
Embla swallows hard and her voice drops to a whisper,
The Dragon,
It’s awakening and its seven eyes are fixed on the Outer Isle,
On the Black Priory!,
The nearby lanterns flicker,
Crawling tendrils of madness stretch greedily towards the Priory,
It hungers for the holy corpse and if it reaches it,
"Embla halts, and for a moment struggles to control her breathing",
You know I’m right,
You can feel it in your guts,
There is no other path out of the Outer Isles except that which leads to the Black Priory and the secrets it holds,
Embla slumps and sighs,
She looks exhausted and for a moment you see her as the quiet and aloof youngling you once knew,
"True to his idiom, Iago swings in on a rope in dramatic fashion, landing elegantly next to you",
"It is good to feel the wind on our faces, no?",
We are about to leave the fjord and from there we may set our course north towards Gradla,
Iago scans the horizon ahead,
The leviathan no doubt stalks us so we must be careful from now on,
We must keep to coastal waters and pray to the Maidens that our speed will keep us safe,
"Nonetheless, we must take every precaution",
"For now, I have posted double look-outs and I’ll be manning the helm myself",
I trust we are in the best of hands,
"Indeed you are. {PLAYER}, come see me in my quarters below later if you wish to talk further",
Iago bows and leaves,
It is out there,
I feel it,
You turn to see Embla standing behind you,
The leviathan,
It hungers,
I suspect the Deep Ones called it here,
"Though, who is the master and who is the servant I cannot tell",
It is certainly older than them,
"You owe me answers, Embla",
Idra is behind us and I need to know why we’re risking our lives on this fool's errand,
I do and now is as good a time as any,
Embla takes you below deck and you find a small corner in the hold that is as close to privacy as can be found on the cramped vessel,
"She takes a deep breath, as if she is about to plunge into freezing water, and begins talking",
"Two years ago I was, let’s say, put on the trail of a rumor that an expedition had been mounted to the Outer Isles",
"More accurately, to an island north of Idra by the name of Gradla",
It’s a cold and barren place but it is allegedly the location of an ancient monastery referred to as “the Black Priory,
The Black Priory?,
"Though you’ve never heard the name before, it echoes in your mind as if stirring old memories",
The site was built a full age into the past and for millennia it stayed unnoticed and far removed from the affairs of the empire,
"So much so, in fact, that it virtually passed out of the historical record centuries ago",
No small feat in an Empire built on the backs of its archivists and record keepers,
And thus it would have remained if it wasn’t for the boundless ambition of a group of powerful men known as the Cabal,
I don’t know who it was that whispered in their ear but something convinced them that the Black Priory was not forgotten,
It was willfully expunged,
Ask!,
Now is the time,
What if it's the corpse of an Emperor?,
What more can you tell me of the Cabal?,
Do you know anything else about the Black Priory?,
Do we stand a chance at rescuing the people who were taken from Horryn?,
I suspect they are already dead… or worse,
You lied to Markus?,
Would you rather I was as blunt to him as I am to you?,
Better they have a sliver of hope,
There are still trials ahead for Markus and the Horrynites and it would do them no good to face it with a broken heart,

# Chapter_4_Firgol,
#,
#FirgolBarkeepScene,
He rubs his hands together in glee!,
Oh yes!,
It’s an old tradition that goes back as far as anyone can remember where the Baron of Firgol invites all us common folk up to the manor to feast,
If you go up there and ask around a bit I’m sure you could come too!,
If you offer to lend a hand that is,
Manor lies north-west of the village - just across the river,
And you said something about cider?,
"Ari, the brewer, makes the best cider this side of the Sea-Gates!",
His brewery is up behind the general store,
Though he might be a bit on the busy side with the Carnivale and all,
Carnivale?,
It’s been quiet as ever and that’s the way we like it here,
Well unless you count the Carnivale preparations of course,
So no unrest here?,
Well we did have Mary’s goat run off and knock over that pail of milk last week if that’s what you mean?,
"But that was mostly funny, mind you",
"A jovial, red-faced man greets you enthusiastically",
Hello-hello and welcome to Firgol!,
Bernard’s my name!,
I’ve not seen your face around here!,
Come for the Carnivale?,
Or perhaps the cider?,
I just had some questions,
Cider?,
Coming right up!,
"So, how are things in Firgol?",
Let's see what's on the menu!,
Have you heard about something called the 'Tower of Ash'?,
What can I get you?,
Lets talk a bit!,
I have indeed!,
"It lies north of here, on the other side of the bay",
"Strange old hermit lives there, they say",
He keeps away from us so we keep away from him,
#FirgolBarmaidScene,
#FirgolBaronesseScene,
Kat lets out a small squeal of joy,
I knew you couldn’t turn down a chance for some fun!,
The Dead knows we could all do with something to take our mind off all the bleakness!,
"Even Roland, it seems, can’t help but smile at the prospect of a night of some light debauchery",
The Baroness exclaims contently,
"With you to aid us, we shall be done in no time!",
"Now, pay attention!",
Embla offers a tired smile in return,
We have much work to do and Gradla beckons me,
But perhaps,
Perhaps a small bit of respite would do us good before we press on?,
Just so long as we don’t tarry for too long,
Roland?,
We'll help!,
Roland sighs,
So much death and dying,
I’m tired,
"If we are to venture into the jaws of madness, I’d like to be able to get shit drunk at least once before we go",
Oh my,
"I dare say things are as they have always been, no?",
Are you sure this isn’t just the grumblings of a few malcontents?,
It didn't seem like 'grumblings' when Horryn was razed,
"You m'lady, are off your rockers",
"Well, if things are indeed a bit on the busier side as of late, I’d venture that there’s nothing people need more than a party to take their minds off the drab monotony of everyday-life",
Wouldn’t you say?,
Perhaps you're right,
How's the planning going?,
So what you’re saying is you and your friends would eat and feast while the peasantry suffers?,
You must hurry up my dear!,
The Carnivale is contingent upon your diligence,
Do think of the children!,
Your task is simple,
Our Carnivale is dependent on the work of some of our beloved villagers,
They may have clever hands but they are a bit on the lazy side,
She chuckles,
And you want me to offer them my aid?,
"Talk to Ari the brewer, Camilla the weaver and Klara the cook",
Offer them your help so we might expedite their tasks,
Give them my warmest greetings and remind them that the Carnivale is nigh,
"Oh, and do try not to mention anything about the surprise",
I positively can’t wait to see their faces!,
"Now my lovely, be on your way!",
We shall await your return,
"An elderly noble woman and a robed, portly man stand in front of the villa’s gate, discussing enthusiastically",
And we shall flank the road with torches for the procession!,
"And as they enter the grounds, my hand-maidens shall place wreaths upon their heads!",
And they shall have their libations as soon as they enter!,
Not a throat shall be dry for the Carnivale!,
The man vigorously nods and takes notes,
Yes m’lady!,
Splendid idea!,
"Well, well Henry, what have we here?",
More revelers come to partake in our great Carnivale!,
Grrrreetings my adorable vagabonds!,
I bid thee welcome to the estates of the Baron of Firgol,
"I am his wife, the Baroness Griselda, and this sweet-cake of a man is our majordomo",
Henry Flagstone,
Henry offers several enthusiastic bows,
Do you mean to say you are not here for the Carnivale?,
Oh what delicious irony!,
The Baroness offers a snorting laugh that seems oddly out of place for a lady of her station,
"You see, my dear husband and I have taken it upon ourselves to arrange a magnificent feast",
A Carnivale where one might eat and drink and say farewell to the sufferings of the flesh!,
There is even an added surprise this year that is sure to elevate the spirits and enlighten the minds of all those who are fortunate enough to attend!,
The Outer Isles are thrown into chaos and you throw a party?,
How delightful!,
Tell me more!,
Typical nobles,
Eating and feasting while the peasantry starve!,
Surprise?,
The Baroness puts on a face of exaggerated sadness,
My dear traveler,
There is a patina of world-weariness over you,
A certain odor one might even say,
Won’t you please reconsider?,
I'll help!,
Kat steps between you and the baroness,
Are you not hearing this?,
Food!,
Drink!,
Entertainment!,
"We’ve been up to our knees in blood and shit and filth and, by the Magis’ balls, who knows when we’ll have a chance like this again!",
Kat grabs you by the shoulders and leans in,
Make,
This,
Happen,
"My dear, is your head made of marzipan?",
An adorable little marzipan piglet with a marzipan head made from eggs and almonds and powdered sugar?,
I can’t be bothered to repeat myself - surely you keep a journal?,
Greetings little one,
Have you come to call upon me?,
Are your tasks done?,
Not yet but I'm working on it!,
The woman looks taken aback,
"My dear, you misunderstand!",
My husband adores the peasantry of this island!,
Salt of the earth he calls them,
This feast is for the common folk of Firgol and they're invited one and all,
It’s a tradition that goes back for generations,
Once a year the Baron of Firgol would always invite the commoners for a night of feasting and drinking!,
"I dare say, this year will be a feast to remember - with the surprise and all",
A night of feast and drink sounds just about right,
Kat mutters under her breath,
So how is the planning going?,
A surprise indeed!,
"Oh, but I cannot help myself but give you a little morsel - Do promise not to tell anyone!",
The lady leans in conspiratorially,
My dear husband is putting on a play for the Carnivale!,
He himself will play the lead role,
Oh he has such wonders to show us,
I’ve never seen him so enthusiastic about anything before,
What kind of play?,
It will be a grand comedy in three acts!,
Or… a drama,
Or… well I can’t exactly remember but it will be spectacular in any case!,
And how is the planning going?,
"Well, as it turns out organizing the Carnivale is quite time-consuming",
In fact I’m a bit overwhelmed with the amount of preparation remaining,
As the Baroness dramatically wafts herself with a fan you can’t help but notice that her majordomo rolls his eyes,
"But perhaps the fates have provided for us after all, Henry?",
"Oh, isn’t it obvious?",
"You seem like a most resolute ragamuffin and I’m sure that if you were to lend a hand, the Carnivale would be under way in no time!",
And you would of course join us in the festivities,
The food and drink will be marvelous!,
Isn’t that just a marvelous idea Henry?,
She excitedly claps her hands and Henry agrees so strongly that his jowls flap,
I really don't know if I have time for this,
What do you say?,
#FirgolBeeHive,
This hive is dead and abandoned,
"Neither bees, nor honeycombs can be found within",
You realize the best way of avoiding the little fiends is to dive into the nearby lake,
Clever thinking!,
Your strategic retreat turns into a route as you are hunted down by the swarm in enraged insectoids,
"Though you eventually outrun them, you are left stung and woozy from the sheer amount of poison pumped into your system",
"You are, however, still alive",
You carefully lift the top off the hive and peer inside,
Immediately a swarm of angry bees fly out and within seconds you feel the burn of several stings!,
They DO sting!,
I hate bees!,
Iben slaps his neck and brushes his face furiously,
Reach inside for the honey,
Use smoke on the bees,
Reconsider and leave,
"Reaching deep into the hive, you pull out a gorgeous honeycomb dripping with rich golden-yellow honey",
"As the smoke effect on the bees begins to wear off, you find it best to make off with your prize",
The hive begins to aggressively buzz as you approach,
The honey inside suddenly seems much less attractive,
"Well, the cook did say that Firgol bees do not sting, yes?",
Iben sounds uncharacteristically hesitant,
"Then again, the cook did say that the bees of Firgol do not sting",
Try to harvest the honey,
"Gingerly, you attempt to reach in",
Suddenly something large shifts in the depths of the hive and swarms of large soldier-bees swarm out to attack,
Each sting feels like a red-hot needle and you can’t help but panic!,
Where can you run to get away from the buzzing horde?,
Flee towards the village,
Flee towards the lake,
Play dead,
Playing dead is a terrible way of escaping hundreds of murderous insectoids,
Your fate is death by acute anaphylactic shock,
"Bursting out from the pile of smoke-stricken bees, comes a single gargantuan individual",
"A large swollen body clad in vibrant yellow chitin, iridescent wings and a face that looks unlike any insect you’ve ever seen before",
This must be a queen!,
The creature lets out a tiny albeit terrifying screech and snaps at your fingers with its jaws,
Ignore queen and get the honey,
Squash the queen,
Swiftly you grasp the creature,
It easily fills up your entire hand and squirms as you tighten your grip around its thorax,
Snapping jaws first hiss and then emit a kind of pained wail as the chitin begins to give way,
Crushing the creature takes a surprising amount of strength until the exoskeleton collapses with a wet squelch,
Gore splatters your face,
Take the honey,
You approach the hive and a slight buzzing rises from within,
"Even with your limited knowledge of bees however, you get a strong impression that there is something wrong with the hive",
Examine the hive,
"Slowly lifting off the top of the hive, you’re able to look inside",
"There are still plenty of bees left, however they seem slow and lethargic",
"Furthermore, there is no honey in sight",
Examine the bees,
Looking around more closely you find several dead bees,
Some clearly belong to the hive in question,
"A handful of others however, look foreign",
Larger and with a vibrant yellow color,
"If you were to guess, you’d say these bees have been fighting bees from another hive",
Who are you kidding?,
You know nothing about bees,
"Smartly using the bee smoker, you fill the hive with calming fumes",
"Before you know it, the buzzing has subsided and you feel confident enough to reach for the honeycombs",
Reach in,
#FirgolBeeKeeperScene,
Please don’t hurt me!,
I’ll give you the bloody smoker,
Just promise you won’t tell anyone,
Pert sobs,
Driina shakes her head,
That was uncalled for,
Don’t you think this poor fool’s had enough misery?,
Hand it over,
No reason to worry about that!,
Firgol bees don’t sting,
"Now, please, just leave me alone!",
"Listen, there's something wrong with your bees",
They seem to be killing each other,
"If you tell me how I can harvest the honey safely, I'll see if I can't help save your hives as well",
"Well, I’m here helping the Baroness organizing the Carnivale and I can only do that if you tell me how to get to the honey",
You better help me or I'll be forced to make you!,
I get going then,
The man’s lips tremble and his eyes water up,
I ‘spose you’re right,
But you have to promise not to tell anyone I helped you!,
I promise,
Firgol bees do not sting!,
And that's the end of it!,
Please just leave me alone!,
You better help me or I'll be forced to hurt you!,
Pert looks around again,
"Oh, I shouldn’t be doing this",
"He sets off at a run and before you know it, he’s gone",
Yes m'lord!,
"I can assure you, Firgol honey is the best in the land",
"Please, go right ahead - the hives are over there",
Let me know if you need any help!,
Yes m'lady!,
But how do I avoid getting stung?,
I better be on my way then!,
Before you stand one of the ugliest men you have ever seen,
"Already cursed at birth, the man’s appearance is not improved by the numerous bee stings that mar his face",
His face contorts into something passing for a smile and he croaks,
Greetings m'lord,
How can I serve?,
Greetings m'lady,
I'm Pert m'lord,
I’m the bee-keeper here in Firgol,
I tend the Baron’s bees,
"He gestures towards the nearby hives and you can’t help but notice that, like his face, his hands are also swollen with bee stings",
I'm Pert m'lady,
Tough job?,
Hello m'lord,
Hello m'lady,
I need to get honey!,
You need to tell me how I'm going to avoid getting stung,
The man wrings his swollen hands while he thinks,
"If I give you the smoker, you might be able to… help my bees?",
"Well, I suppose I can give you the smoker if you promise not to tell anyone!",
The man looks around nervously and hands you a small tin can with a handle and a spout,
"This is a bee smoker, see",
You just mix kindling with some wet grass and light a fire,
Not too hot mind you!,
You only want a bit of smoke,
Just open the hive carefully and let the smoke settle inside and the bees will go all drowsy,
But please,
Don’t tell anyone I use the bee smoker,
Firgol bees don’t sting!,
Oh no!,
Not in the slightest m'lord,
Firgol bees don’t sting you see!,
They’re as docile as cows,
And that’s good because the Baroness wouldn’t want it any other way,
Not in the slightest m'lady,
They don't look docile!,
Point to his stings,
In fact I'm helping out the Baroness,
I've come ot fetch honey!,
The man half averts his face in shame as you point out his stings,
It’s as the Baroness says,
And if they do then it’s my own bloody fault!,
That’s all there’s to be said about that,
"Well, I'm here for some honey",
"Well, I best be going",
#FirgolBrewerScene,
Of course!,
My lad sells it by the bottle in front of the general store,
"Oh, and Bernard might even have a few bottles left over at the inn",
The man can’t help but hide his disappointment,
"Oh… well, suit yourself I suppose",
What can I do for you then?,
"A pot-bellied man hums to himself as he pours a clear, golden liquid from glass to glass, swirling it around and then tasting it",
He thoughtfully sloshes it around in his mouth a few times and then spits it into a bucket,
Taste funny?,
Oh my no!,
This cider is my best batch yet,
He looks at you with a roguish smile,
Only problem is my wife gets a bit on the sour side if I come home red-cheeked after tasting the wares all day,
The man chuckles and offers his hand,
"I’m Ari, I run the local brewery",
I’d wager you’ll find no finer cider in all of the Northern Empire - And certainly not in the outer isles,
Here!,
Have a try!,
Ari offers a glass of the golden cider,
Accept,
No thank you,
Did she now?,
"Aye, she’s ordered the beverages for the Carnivale for me",
He leans in and lowers his voice,
By the barrel load,
"Let me tell you, it’ll be a night to remember",
Good for business as well,
She’s paid me out the nose,
So what's the hold-up?,
Ah I don’t really have a good excuse,
Barrels are lined up and almost ready to go,
But there’s just been so much to do around the farm and I sort of… forgot,
A hint of despair flashes across his jovial face,
Do you ever wonder ‘what’s the use'?,
"Like, it’s all dust on black winds in the end?",
Anything I can do to help you?,
I suppose there is actually!,
The cloud of despair seems to lift and at once the man’s light-hearted demeanor returns,
Moles have been tearing up my orchard real bad,
They gnaw at the roots and wreak havoc on the trees,
They’ve stood for hundreds of years you know and losing even a single one is a disaster,
You wnat me to go mole hunting?,
You offered to help didn’t you?,
"If you could deal with the mole problem, I could devote my full attention to getting the cider delivered at the Baron’s villa!",
My orchard is just north of here,
I’ve counted at least three burrows but they can be hard to spot so make sure you search properly,
"When you find them, dig those little bastards out and return to me once you’re done!",
Ari hands you a shovel and slaps you on the back,
You can’t help but feel that a bit of spring has returned to his step,
"By Strange Moons, you did it!",
I can’t tell you how good it is to see my trees all nice and secure,
I’ve not much to give you but I think I can spare some coins and a few bottles of cider that ‘fell off the wagon’,
Ari winks at you and throws you a small sack of coins,
Barrels of cider are loaded on carts and you watch as the brewer and his helpers set off for the Barno’s villa,
"No doubt, the drink will flow soon enough!",
What did you need me to do?,
I've cleared out the moles!,
The Baroness told me to ask if you needed help!,
About your task,
Can I buy some of your cider?,
What's your secret to making the cider so good?,
I'll see you later,
As I’ve said,
There are at least three mole-burrows there if you search properly,
"When you find them, use a shovel and dig those little bastards out",
Return to me once you’re done!,
Wel - 'hic' - come back!,
"The beverage is cool, sweet and sparkly - truly is some of the best cider you’ve ever had",
"Good, yes?",
Ari nods in eager anticipation as you drink,
"Let me, let me, let me!",
"Kat greedily grabs the cup from you, drinks deeply and then belches in a way that is decidedly unladylike",
Magi’s ball,
Is there any more?,
Her eyes are wide with excitement,
It's indeed excellent,
Do you mind if I ask some questions?,
"I remember one of them Imperial surveyors called it ‘micro climate’, At least that’s what I think he said!",
Means that the area around Firgol is real mild and soft on the fruit trees compared to the rest of the outer isles,
"And then, since we’re so far north everything takes a long time to grow and ripen and that’s what causes the fruits to be so sweet",
He gives you an impish smile,
There’s that and then there’s the family secrets of course,
"My family has been doing this for a long, long time",
#FirgolCarnivale1,
All your work is done and now you’ve come to feast!,
My husband is ever so grateful for all you have done for him and I dare say this will be a night to remember,
"My dear, Carnivale is about to begin",
Behold!,
Coming up the road is a procession of villagers,
"Clad in their finest and with beautiful wreaths of flowers on their head, the simple folk of Firgol gasp in awe as they pass under the flowered arch of the manor’s gate",
"Tastes like no other, sights like no other, flesh like no other",
What wonder we shall show you tonight,
The Baroness has moved much closer and you feel her breath on your ear,
"Then, raising her voice again, she exclaims in an official tone",
I declare that Carnivale has begun!,
"Eat, drink and revel!",
I shall retire momentarily and make my final preparations,
As a lady must,
The Baroness and her handmaidens retire into the manor,
"You are left, head spinning, as the scents of fine food and sounds of merriment begin to fill the air",
The pain and toil of the last weeks begins to fade,
All that is left is Carnivale,
Begin,
#FirgolCarnivalePlay,
The simple folk of Firgol find their place in silence,
A sense of reverence appears to have fallen over them,
You scan the rows for an empty seat,
Sit with Roland,
Sit with Kat,
Sit with Embla,
Sit with Driina,
Sit with Iben,
Sit alone,
A man dressed in the colorful garb of a traveling theater performer walks onto the stage and the crowd falls utterly silent,
Grrrrrreetings!,
"His voice is high-pitched and overly dramatic, yet oddly captivating",
"On foreign shores we set our play,",
"Where setting suns casts shadows long,",
"O’er streets no longer touched by day,",
And halls forgotten but in song,
"Strange is the night where black stars rise,",
"With flapping of the tattered wings,",
"And strange moons circle through the skies,",
Chased by black and faceless things,
An edifice where kings once sat,
"Where maidens pale did once cavort,",
"The charnel house that time begat,",
A stranger has arrived at court,
The strange little man bows deeply and walks off stage,
"For a long moment all is quiet, yet the crowd sits frozen with anticipation",
Then a sharp gasp from one of the onlookers,
You crane your neck trying to get a better view but there is nothing there!,
Or…?,
You see it,
A robed and gloved hand dramatically extends onto the stage from between two of the backdrop panels,
"Slowly he emerges; a tall figure, gliding more than walking with elegant, almost dance-like motions",
The Baron!,
It must be!,
whispers one of the audience,
Look!,
whispers another,
He wears a mask!,
The figure glides onto the center of the stage,
"Like some strange pantomime, he begins to wordlessly orate with dramatic, exaggerated gestures",
Or was it wordless?,
Weren't there words hidden in the silence?,
Terrible words!,
Hints of secrets no mortal mind was meant to hold,
The unspoken words seep into your mind like a poison,
You wince,
someone pleads,
The time has come for you to unmask!,
The words sound strange,
"Like an echo older than time, doomed to repeat for all eternity",
Slowly the Baron turns his masked face towards the speaker,
The words that follow are the only ones you could later recall,
I WEAR NO MASK,
Inhuman howls of terror mix with the gibbering laughter of the insane,
Teeth shatter in clenched jaws and eyes are torn from sockets,
Hair pulled out in great clumps and loved ones claw each other to death,
HE exists now only as the afterimage of an eclipse and then he is gone,
Nowhere and everywhere,
"Like a tide of gnawing eye-less things, madness overwhelms you",
You sink to your knees clawing at your skull in a vain attempt to dislodge the terrible words that have taken place there,
"Then, like a ray of light, something cuts through the morass",
A hand on your shoulder,
You turn and see,
You get up,
The only way out is through,
Then it strikes you,
"The terrible crystal revelation that you are, and will forever be, alone",
No one is going to save you but yourself,
Death may be coming but not now and not like this,
You get to your feet and prepare to fight,
lorem ipsum,
"The stage is set, but the play is not yet ready to begin",
Eat!,
Revel!,
"Sitting down, you notice the backdrops for the first time",
Camilla’s hauntingly vibrant scene looks at once familiar yet subtly alien,
"For a moment, the cloud waves seem to break upon the shore as twin suns set",
Watch the play,
Driina sits back straight and eyes closed with her hands in her lap,
You see her breathing slowly and deeply,
"As you sit down, without opening her eyes, she smiles ever so slightly",
What a nice surprise,
"Come, I think it’s about to begin",
"For the first time, you notice the backdrops",
Driina gasps next to you,
No doubt in awe of the artwork’s vivid nature,
Try to hold her hand,
Embla sits in deep thought,
It would appear all the nights revelries were not enough to lighten the burden she carries,
As you sit down she looks up at you and blinks as if waking from a dream,
I’m sorry I was lost in thought,
But let’s not speak of such things for now,
"Come, let us watch the play",
Embla gasps next to you,
Iben sits red-faced and smiling with a mug of ale in his hand,
He jovially quips and jests and exchanges toasts as people pass him to find their places,
His eyes light up when he sees you,
I’ve saved you a seat!,
Sit and look around,
Iben gasps next to you,
Try to hold his hand,
Kat sits wide-eyed in amazement as she takes in every sight and sound,
Rosy cheeks tells you she’s enjoyed her night and she beams up at you as you take the seat next to her,
Would you believe this is my first time?,
At the theater I mean,
I can’t wait for it to begin!,
Kat gasps next to you,
The hulking man sits arms-crossed and with furrowed brow,
"Like a misplaced tool, he looks quite out of place in a theater-crowd",
As you sit next to him he notices the unspoken question and with a grunt and the hint of a smile he growls,
I hate crowds,
Roland gasps next to you,
Take his hand,
#FirgolCarnivaleRevel,
The song and laughter echoing throughout the courtyard is a testament to the quality of Ari's Cider,
You eagerly grab a mug,
and drink it alone,
The rich flavor of the cider leaves you red-cheeked and light-headed,
You cannot help but laugh,
Loud and uninhibited,
You laugh because there is no evil in the world,
"Or perhaps because there is so much of it and yet, here you stand?",
The table overflows with the treats from Klara’s kitchen,
Your mouth waters as you stand momentarily paralyzed by the abundance of choice,
The urge to partake is almost primal,
A sublime piece of stuffed pastry,
"Lying there alone, a vibrant platonic ideal, almost beckoning you",
Gingerly you pick it up,
It’s feather-light,
Wolf it down!,
"Biting into the pastry, its perfect crust yields up the soft crumb-flesh with a satisfying crunch",
"The jam-filled interior bursts in your mouth; Apples, sugar, cinnamon - a touch of lemon",
Ecstasy,
This is the best stuffed pastry you’ve ever had,
"Resplendently attired and with her handmaidens in tow, the baroness emerges from the manor",
The music dies down,
Beloved guests!,
The second act is upon us!,
My beloved husband asks that you take your places in front of the stage,
The time has come for the evening's surprise,
And for all our rosy-cheeked little crumplins there is a special surprise,
My lovely ladies and I have prepared a scavenger hunt!,
There will be whimsy and prizes and sweets!,
The children clap their pudgy hands as they squeal with joy,
Is there one among you with the courage to brave the manor and find the treasure within?,
Come one - come all!,
The children stream past the baroness into the manor while the adults begin to file towards the rows of benches placed in front of the stage,
It is time for you to take your place,
The music filling the air is raw and primal,
Its beat is the pulse of something vast waiting to be born,
The piper at the gates of dawn,
It drives you,
Carries you,
A howl builds inside,
You give in to it,
Dance like no one’s watching,
You sway and leap and whirl to the mesmerizing beat,
For a moment you are one with something,
With everything or nothing,
There really isn't a difference,
"Stars wheel overhead and by the time the trance ends it takes a moment for you to remember where, or even when, you are",
#FirgolCassildaScene,
A young woman dressed in the manner of a wandering minstrel stands alone looking out across the small lake,
She hums softly to herself - stopping and starting over as if trying to think of words for a song,
Are you Cass?,
The woman blinks in surprise,
"What, you’ve heard of me then?",
"Wait, is this about that bar-tab?",
"As I’ve already told Bernard, I’ll pay him the moment I have the coin on hand",
It’s just that I’ve been a bit preoccupied,
Cass looks at her feet,
Camilla asked me to talk to you,
A pained expression falls across her face,
Please don’t say she’s angry with me,
She's sad you weren't interested in her,
Not interested?!,
I’m crazy for her,
Finding her note made me happier than words can describe,
Then why didn't you respond?,
Because I couldn’t find the words,
Can you believe it?,
"Me, a bard, at a loss for words!",
I’ve been trying to put my feelings into verse,
A song,
"I’m nearly there, but over and over, the words escape me",
I don’t understand it,
It feels like I’m grasping at tendrils of mist,
Can I hear what you have so far?,
The song Cass reads to you is sad and beautiful,
It brings to mind images of far and wondrous shores,
"Stranger yet, is the fact that try as you might, you have never been able to recall the first three verses she recounted to you",
Only the first line of the last verse remains,
"Song of my soul, my voice is dead",
That’s exactly it,
I can’t get past that,
Nor can I change it,
It has to be that line!,
But what comes next?,
It’s like I’m deaf to my own inner voice!,
"Cass repeats the line, now with a slight hint of panic in her voice",
"Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed",
Cass squeezes your hand and offers a warm but slightly sad smile before walking off,
You’re left with the note for Camilla,
The woman appears lost in thought as she mumbles the verse of some half-composed song to herself over and over,
The words flow from your mouth and fits the song like a key fits a lock,
"You spoke more words as well, but like the rest of the song, they too are lost in the void of time",
"What you do remember however, is Cass scribbling the words down as tears of joy streamed down her face",
That’s it!,
I have it,
A song for Camilla,
She folds the piece of paper containing the words of the song neatly and writes in beautiful cursive,
To Camilla - From Cassilda,
With trembling hands she offers you the folded note,
Would you do me one last favor,
Take this note to Camilla,
It will explain everything to her,
And please,
Would you tell her to come find me at the Carnivale?,
Tell her we’ll dance together then,
#FirgolCiderMerchantScene,
The Baron and Baroness are arranging it!,
It’ll have food and drink and even a surprise they say!,
"If you haven’t already done so, you should go talk to the Baroness and offer to help!",
I’m sure she’ll let you attend if you help out,
"My da’s supplying the drinks, you see!",
The boy beams with pride and excitement,
A party?,
When the Outer Isles flow with blood?,
"Ah, I see",
The boy’s eyes water over,
I’m sorry I don’t know anything about any blood or any such,
I’m just looking forward to the party,
It’s not often us common folk get to experience something like that,
Well the Carnivale of course!,
I can’t wait!,
They say it’s going to be one for the ages!,
My da’ might need a hand!,
He’s been a bit flustered about getting his shipment of cider ready for the Carnivale and all,
Something about moles in the orchard,
I’m sure you’ll find him in the brewery somewhere,
In the warehouse maybe?,
I'll go talk to him then!,
A smiling young lad with a shock of yellow hair calls out to you,
Greetings traveler!,
Can I interest you in some fine Firgol cider?,
"I promise, you’ll not get it fresher of better anywhere in the Outer Isles!",
Sounds like a local specialty?,
It doesn’t get more local than this!,
My da’ makes it right here at the family brewery!,
He motions to the buildings behind him,
Now what will it be?,
Can I interest you in a few bottles?,
Perhaps later but I had some questions first!,
Can I buy some cider?,
What's going on here in Firgol?,
Hi there!,
Back for more cider?,
#FirgolEnter,
"As Roland slinks off, Iben walks up to you",
Cruel deeds scar those who perform them as much as their victims and Roland is a man with many scars,
As you approach the small cluster of quaint houses you can’t help but be struck by a feeling of calm and peace you’ve not felt in a long time,
"By the grace of the Golden Dead, it would appear a small sliver of life as it once was in the Outer Isles has survived",
Driina says with a sad smile,
"Ahead on your right, lies a tavern that looks exactly like the kind of tavern where the meals are hearty and the ale cooled just right",
Your stomach growls at the thought,
"Kat stares, mouth agape, first at the tavern and then at you pleadingly",
We’re stopping by there whether you want to or not!,
"You continue on your way, and for a moment an irrational fear passes over you",
"Will you be able to return to the cold, brutal world at large if you spend too much time in this quite little piece of bliss?",
"Looking around, you notice Roland has fallen behind the group and now stands, seemingly transfixed, a few steps behind you",
What's wrong Roland?,
Is it a trap?,
No time to linger,
He blinks a few times with watery eyes and an expression that is hard to place,
Families,
Children,
Feeling homesick?,
He looks down and for a moment you could have sworn he looks ashamed,
Let's just get some bloody ale,
His voice breaks in a way that is uncharacteristic for the laconic brute,
#FirgolGeneralGoodsScene,
Ask about Firgol,
Ask about Help,
Show me your goods!,
Something about Firgol,
More about Firgol,
Finally the last part about Firgol,
Something about Help,
More about Help,
Finally the last part about Help,
#FirgolInnCookScene,
Their line has ruled over Firgol for a long time,
They live in the villa north-west of the village,
Just across the stream,
I’m sure the Baroness would appreciate it if you called upon her,
She’s eccentric but she means well - loves the children of the village,
I had some other things I wanted to ask you,
"In fact, the Baroness told me to ask if you needed help!",
"Well, the Carnivale is nigh, right?",
"That means plenty of extra work for me but the thing is, there’s still the inn to take care of!",
"Who’s going to cook for the guest, you know?",
"Well, the Baroness told me to ask if you needed help!",
The Carnivale is the time to feast and drink and dance,
It’s the Baron and the Baroness’ way of showing their love for us common folk,
Baron and the Baroness?,
Besides the Carnivale?,
Nothing - and that's just the way we prefer!,
Really?,
Nothing?,
Idra was nearly overrun by Reavers and Horryn was all but sacked!,
"Well, I ain’t seen no ‘Reavers’ here and if I do, I’ll be sure to show them the back of my hand!",
Let's talk about something else,
"A woman bustles about the kitchen, stirring pots, adding spices and tending fires",
"I beg your pardon, but I’m not really in any position to talk right now!",
Why so busy?,
"Please, I just had a few questions!",
"Well, come to think of it, there is actually something you could help me with",
Name it!,
"See, the Baroness has asked me to prepare something special for the children of the feast",
My famed honey cakes,
"Only problem is, I’m still waiting on the honey",
Perhaps you could be a dear and run over to the beehives and fetch it for me?,
Will any honey do?,
It needs to be honey from our own hives,
There’s nothing quite like it,
And where do I find these beehives?,
The bee-hives lie to the west of the village,
Just cross the bridge and continue straight ahead and you’ll see them on your left-hand side eventually,
I think even a single honeycomb should do it!,
See if you can’t find Pert the beekeeper,
He’ll help you,
But how will I avoid getting stung?,
Klara chuckles a heart laugh and slaps her knee,
Oh I wouldn’t worry about that!,
We wouldn’t want the children to not get their honey-cakes!,
I'll do my best!,
I need you to fetch at least five honey-combs for me from the beehives west of town,
Just cross the bridge and continue straight ahead until you see them on your left-hand side,
Look at these honey-combs!,
Have you ever seen honey this golden?,
The children will love this,
"Oh, the Baroness is going to be so pleased",
"Now, the cakes are for the children but I’ll tell you what",
I baked one too many apple-pies for the feast,
It’s yours if you want it,
Klara winks at you and hands you a fresh apple pie,
"Now, off you go!",
I have the honey!,
Go on then!,
Can you teach me a few recipes?,
What's going on in Firgol?,
Want to learn how to cook eh?,
Well I can’t blame you,
Nothing soothes the soul like a home-cooked meal,
Have a look in my recipe-book,
I’ll teach you for a few coins per recipe!,
Browse Recipes,
"Klara rushes back and forth, red-faced and sweating but with movements that seem so choreographed and intentional that she appears more like a dancer than a cook",
You are truly watching a master at work here,
Let's talk for a bit!,
#FirgolManorEnter,
The scene before you is one of utter insanity,
The Baroness presides over it with a look of exhausted contentment on her face,
I’m so glad to see you here,
The great work is nearly done and I couldn’t have done it without you,
It’s only fitting you should be here at the finale,
She produces a long dagger from her sleeve,
Put down the dagger!,
Beyond hope and reason you see that the children are still alive - albeit paralyzed in some kind of trance,
The Baroness begins laughing but the sound morphs into a wailing cry of sorrow and anger,
They are mine now!,
Why shouldn’t I have one as well!,
Every fucking cow with a cunt in the village can squeeze one out SO WHY CAN’T I?!,
She screams and lunges for the nearest child,
#FirgolManorFinal,
"Sitting in silent majesty upon the throne, is the desiccated corpse of what must have been the Baron of Firgol",
"Tattered, yellow robes hang loosely from the body and around the head, a thin crown of ivy has grown",
A king out of time,
"Though similar, this figure cannot be the one that performed that horrid play",
"And even as you stand here, the memory of it has begun to fade",
"Like a dream upon waking, you are left wondering if it even happened at all",
"No matter, there is nothing more here for you now",
Only bones dust,
You turn to leave,
"For a moment you imagine that you hear the flapping of tattered robes, but then it passes",
#FirgolMoleBurrow,
You dig the shovel into the soft soil and easily collapse the burrow,
"After a few strokes however, the shovel-head comes up coated in dark blood",
"You root through the soil and to your disgust find numerous, small, hairless blobs of flesh that have been hacked to death by the shovel’s action",
"You can’t properly identify the strange things, nor do you want to, and quickly cover up the gruesome scene with dirt before moving along",
"More carefully this time, you set to work collapsing the second tunnel",
The work progresses nicely until suddenly the earth shifts slightly as if something is moving underneath,
"Whatever it is, it grabs onto the shovel blade and tugs violently at it!",
You yank back with all your might and manage to free the shovel from whatever lurks under the dirt,
"Swinging wildly, you pummel the ground and walk away hoping you’ve seen the last of whatever lurks underneath this orchard",
Arriving at the third hole you feel an unease grow in your stomach,
"Carefully, you bend down and try to peer into the small, dark burrow",
"To your horror, something glances back",
A pair of eyes that appear far too intelligent than an animal has any right to be,
"Then, in an instance they are gone - retreated underground",
Perhaps your mind is playing tricks on you?,
"You decide to not wait and find out and with a slight hint of panic, you utterly demolish the hole",
Your task is done and you should return to Ari,
You come across a freshly dug hole in the ground,
Dig out the burrow,
#FirgolQuestOver,
"As you leave the grounds of the accursed manor, your head spins and nausea overcomes you",
The things you have seen linger in your mind like the after-images of some alien sun burned into your eyes,
"Try as you might you will neither be able to exorcize the memories, nor ever make sense of them",
Embla puts her hand on your shoulder,
Are you alright?,
"Somewhere, Kat alternates between crying and retching",
I don't think I'll be 'alright' ever again,
I suspect none of us ever will,
The Dragon spreads its poison unto all the things it touches,
There is nowhere safe,
Not even this tiny little village,
"Now more than ever, I am certain that the only way forward is to the very heart of darkness",
To Gradla and the Black Priory,
Embla helps you up,
Indeed it would seem there is no going back,
#FirgolWeaverScene,
A young maiden stands looking at a pile of white canvas cloth,
She sighs deeply and appears to be lost in deep thought,
Is something wrong?,
"Oh, I didn’t see you there",
I’m sorry if I seem rude but I’d rather just be left alone,
She offers a weak but apologetic smile,
Camilla’s eyes tear up,
I’m,
I’m so ashamed,
The Baroness was so kind to think of me for making the backdrops for their ‘surprise’,
I thought I could do it,
I have the canvases and everything,
All she asked was that I paint her a ‘wondrous vista’,
But I can’t bring myself to make the first stroke,
Why not?,
Camilla blushes,
I'm lost,
"My head, My heart",
"There’s a girl, Cass, and I have… feelings for her",
It was from a distance but I felt like there was something there,
"Me being me, I didn’t have the nerve to go talk to her",
Instead I left a note for her explaining my feelings,
And then?,
Nothing at all,
"Oh, I’m such an oaf",
I write like a pig - How could I ever think my stupid note could sway someone like Cass,
Tears stream down Camilla’s face,
She has such a way with words,
"A bard, she is",
And me?,
I’m just stupid and plain,
What if I talked to Cass for you?,
You would do that for me?,
I suppose it would let me know one way or another,
"But please, try to be subtle about it",
Don’t let her know I’m besides myself thinking about her,
She draws in a deep breath and her mood appears to lift ever so slightly,
Cass is a free spirit and she loves the water,
I’d look for her along the small creek that runs west of here,
Thank you so much for offering to help,
I'll return when I have news,
"Well, since you offered to help I would really appreciate it if you talked to Cass for me",
I need to know if she got my note and what her feelings are for me,
Just look for her along the creek west of the village,
Camilla goes pale,
What… what did she say?,
"She doesn’t fancy me, right?",
I just know it!,
She asked me to give you this,
She accepts the note and slowly unfolds it,
"As she consumes the song, line by line, her eyes water and her hands tremble",
"By the end, she has to tear her eyes away from it",
Such words,
I’ve never read such words,
Was there more?,
Did she say anything?,
She told me she wanted to dance with you at the Carnivale,
"Camilla covers her mouth, smiling through tears of joy",
She then blinks a few times as if remembering something,
The backdrops for the Baroness!,
I see it so clearly now,
Cass’ song,
"Oh, this will be amazing!",
Glad I could help!,
"And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get to work",
I’d rather you not see the result until at the Carnivale,
It’ll be more impressive that way!,
Camilla smiles a secretive smile and grabs a ream of canvas and a pot of paint before hastily walking off,
What about the quest?,
I've talked to Cass,
Hello again,
Camilla smiles timidly,
"Oh, I’ve said too much",
The Baroness made me promise not to tell,
"Please, you need to ask her if you want to know more",
Not that it matters in any case,
I’m getting nowhere with this,
She motions to the reams of canvas,
And why is that?,

#GradlaSpotted,
Land ho!,
sounds the cry from the crows nest,
Iago offers you a spyglass,
There!,
Fogbanks to the north,
Gradla’s southern shore,
If I remember correctly the coastline is littered with underwater reefs and dangerous to navigate,
I fear we cannot follow it without being forced into deeper waters and within grasp of the Behemoth,
"Embla, what now?",
Embla closes her eyes for a moment as if recalling some distant memory,
The Priory lies on the plateau of the mountain chain that dominates Gradla’s inland,
"As far as I know, the Cabal expedition landed at a small mining-village called Adler’s Helm and proceeded from there",
"Iago, what do you recommend?",
Iago carefully scans the emerging shoreline,
I suspect we will not be able to reach Adler’s Helm without exposing ourselves to the dangers of the high seas,
"If you are to reach the village, you must land on the southern shore and then travel overland",
Let's make landfall!,
#GradlaSpottedVulcano,
"Ahead, a volcanic peaks of mount Karaban rises steeply",
It lies there like some giant of titanic proportions that is thankfully still asleep,
If it were to awaken however,
"You shudder at the thought, thankful that your journey takes you in a different direction",
#OverlandEnterBadland,
Katabatic winds howl through the valley,
"To the north, great snow-covered peaks loom over you like the ramparts of some great, cosmic fortress",
Embla leans in and shouts over the wind,
These are the interior mountains!,
We must find a way to ascend them to reach the plateau and the Priory!,
And we'll find that in Adler's Helm?,
"All I know is that the Cabal expedition traveled there, and that means we must too",
"I’m sure once we get there, the way will somehow reveal itself",
That's a lot to hope for,
"For now, let’s just try to get there in one piece",
"From what I understand, Adler’s Helm lies somewhere near the north-eastern parts of this mountain-range",
"If we follow its circumference, I believe we’ll eventually arrive there",

#PrioryCaveAncientRoom,
"Like the tons of stone that presses down from above, so does this chamber convey the weight of untold eons",
"Rows of embalmed corpses line the wall, sitting in perfect stillness with empty eye-sockets that stare into eternity",
How long have they been here?,
These men and women came here to worship long before the first stone of the Empire was laid,
Their corpses were already ancient when Gallian landed on Erdahn’s shores,
A strange thought occurs to you,
These corpses are ‘dreaming’,
Waiting and dreaming,
Waiting on what?,
They… are ‘dreaming’,
You turn and realize it was Kat who spoke,
She looks surprised,
I don’t know why I said that,
The thought just came to me!,
"But, they ARE dreaming",
Sharing the Sleeper’s dream,
Waiting for him to return to them,
Where are these thoughts coming from?!,
Can we please leave?,
"Yes, let's move",
#PrioryCaveBossFight,
The strange construct rises menacingly above you,
"As you approach, the fungal growths that cling to it writhe in greedy anticipation - clawing impotently at the portal set into the structure’s side",
You cannot easily discern the material used in its construction nor the hands that made it beyond the fact that there is an aspect about it that makes you think of the artifacts that the Magi sometimes employ,
"Now, its outer skin is pockmarked and weathered by the shifting of stone over endless millennia",
"For the briefest moment you see it in your mind's eye, free of stone, moving over a landscape of jagged mountains and jungle-clad hills",
"Great ferns sway in the humid breeze, and in the distance you see great, singing towers",
A sudden tremor shakes you out of it,
This one more violent than the previous ones,
"As you reel from the quake, Embla walks past you, moving towards the portal with her hand outstretched like a sleepwalker",
The air hums with energy that appears to be emanating from the portal itself,
The fungal tentacles begin to thrash wildly in anticipation,
"The tremors return, more powerful now, and around you stones fall from the cave’s roof",
"Embla, wait!",
"She does not hear you and before you can grab her, she has touched the door",
The effect is instant,
Strangely shaped glyphs set into the portal begin to glow with a light so bright it’s nearly blinding,
"An undulating vibration that you feel in your bones rises and echoes through the cave and for a moment it sounds as if someone, or something is howling madly",
Then sudden silence,
What was,
"Before you can finish your sentence, the ground again shakes violently, knocking you to the ground",
Rocks and debris explode outwards from the center of the cave and an inhuman roar so loud it causes your ears to bleed emits from the horror that emerges into the cave,
"Bursting forth from the depths below, it towers above you",
"A squirming mass of untold millions of strands of fungal growths animated into a gigantic, mawed worm-horror",
Tentacles thrash wildly with enough force to break rock as the abomination claws its way out of the emergence hole and towards you,
Embedded into its roiling half-flesh are the forms and faces of men,
You know with certainty that these are indeed the final members of the Cabal expedition,
Stagger to your feet,
"The creature lumbers towards you, emitting yet another terrible scream",
Your heart sinks as you set to receive the charge,
From around you echoes dozens of replies as its smaller siblings are called forth to the feast,
#PrioryCaveSpottedShip,
The cave expands into a vast chamber littered by the remains of what you deem to be the final resting-place of the Cabal expedition to the Black Priory,
Large quantities of stone and dirt have been shifted in what appears like an attempt to excavate… what?,
Your eyes strain in an attempt to make sense of the structure partially protruding from the rock,
"Your mind reels at the thought that whatever this is, it must have been placed here thousands, nay, hundreds of thousands of years ago",
"What’s more, despite seeing just a small segment of the structure, you feel certain that whatever is buried here is vast",
We’re here!,
We’ve made it!,
"All these years, this is what was buried under the Priory",
This is where the Sleeper awaits!,
Emblas voice trembles like a prisoner who senses that freedom is finally within reach,
T-this thing,
It cannot exist,
It should not!,
Who can build something like this?,
Driina’s voice is the closest to panic you’ve ever heard her,
This is the very heart of madness itself,
Roland whispers to himself,
The sleeper awaits,
#PrioryDreamChamber,
I think the monks came down here to commune with him using those machines,
Dreaming his dreams,
You walk over to the shaft and peer down it,
There is no end in sight,
"Whatever lies at the bottom, lies far below this level of the catacombs",
The octagonal room has four throne-like machines arranged around a central aperture,
"Thick, squirming tentacles spew forth from the shaft, and you can’t help but wonder where it terminates",
"A strange humming can be felt, rather than heard, coming from the center of the room",
Examine the machines,
"Though no doubt some form of arcane machinery, it’s beyond your ken and you feel loath to examine it further",
"Leaning in, you examine the indentation further and notice inlays of pure sylver radiating out from where the user’s skull would be",
"You follow the inlays, and find that they seem to converge towards the room’s central shaft",
"Intricately wrought in a complex design that appears more like machinery than decoration, each throne has an indentation that would accommodate a human figure",
"If you were to guess, you’d say that this machinery somehow attunes and connects the user to Reticular vibrations emanating from the shaft",
As to what is generating those vibrations,
Could it be the holy corpse?,
#PrioryDungeonAmbush1,
"As you enter the hall, a mass of misshapen flesh and slavering jaws spill forth from shadows and darkened side-passages!",
You can’t help but think that the glistening and slimy horrors before you look as if they were birthed into existence recently,
No doubt they are now ravenously hungry,
#PrioryDungeonAmbush2,
Forces pull at you - driving you inexorably forwards,
"You are, you are no doubt, nearing something",
What’s wrong?,
Why do we stop?,
Embla asks impatiently,
I have a strange feeling,
A feeling we’re being watched!,
snarls Roland as he turns to face the amorphous eye-things that glide silently down from the ceiling to prey upon you!,
"Before you can finish the thought, movement catches your eye and you whirl around to face the amorphous eye-things that glide silently down from the ceiling to prey upon you!",
#PrioryDungeonDarkness,
Our path takes us into peerless darkness then?,
Iben rubs his chin thoughtfully,
"We’ve survived countless horrors thus far but I dare say, we must keep our wits about us now and proceed with the utmost caution",
I can think of few fates worse than being lost and waylaid in this morass of darkness,
You must keep your wits about you if you are to proceed,
Take all precautions not to lose your way and ensure all possible preparations are made before you set forth,
"The tunnel ahead is ancient, narrow and dark",
"Walking down it, you cannot help but feel as if you are descending into some deeper abyss - far more ancient than the Priory and reluctant to give up its mysteries",
"Nonetheless, you also cannot help but feel as if you are once more being pulled forwards",
Something awaits you at the other end of these tunnels and it’s beckoning for you to proceed,
You feel it too now don’t you?,
Embla attempts to peer into the darkness ahead,
This is the way,
The tomb-chamber was never what the Priory was built to protect,
There must be even older mysteries below,
I suspect many of the monks themselves didn’t know of this,
Perhaps initiates offered praise to a false tomb for centuries while the Grandmasters kept the lie?,
Let's move onwards then,
Not to interrupt your theosophic ramblings but there’s something you might want to see {PLAYER},
Kat has walked up to the edge of the light and is carefully extending her arm into the darkness,
The darkness will not yield to the light,
It’s as thick as tar,
Some kind of ward perhaps?,
I suspect we’ll need to navigate these tunnels blindly,
You walk up to the edge of the light and realize that the darkness does not appear to lift no matter how much light is present,
The tunnels appear to be kept in some kind of perpetual darkness and it seems you must navigate them blindly,
#PrioryDungeonGong,
"You strike the gong a third time but as you utter the last name, the note sounds foul and discordant",
Whatever you did you suspect it was somehow wrong,
Perhaps you should start over?,
"A large, gilded gong that no doubt must have served some kind of ceremonial purpose",
Etched into it in fine lettering is the following text,
"He who wishes to pass so bold, Speak the names of masters of old!",
"And before the sleeper he beseech, Shall offer up a strike for each!",
Ring the Gong,
You speak the name,
Strike again and say the name 'Rothrax',
Strike again and say the name 'Carroleth',
Strike again and say the name 'Kalamar',
You strike again and speak the second name,
"You strike the gong with the mallet and a pure, deep note reverberates through the complex",
Say the name 'Rothrax',
Say the name 'Carroleth',
Say the name 'Kalamar',
You strike the gong with whatever is at hand and a dull note emanates from it,
You suspect only striking it with the correct tool will produce a proper note,
You ring the gong a third time and speaks the last name,
The sound echoes more strongly than before through the catacombs and the grinding of stones can be heard in the room ahead,
"Whatever you did, you suspect it was the right thing",
#PrioryDungeonPitTrap,
"With a mechanical click, the floor gives way under your",
Your short drop is arrested by the vicious spikes that cover the floor of the pit,
Your adventure has come to an end,
#PrioryDungeonSpottenTomb,
Embla points through the passage to the north,
A golden tomb!,
We must be close now,
Finally we shall know!,
What do we do if you're right?,
I do not know,
But the answers will reveal themselves to us when we stand before the glorious corpse,
I just pray we’re not too late!,
The corpse of an Emperor?,
In a place like this?,
I refuse to believe it,
#PrioryEnterCave,
The air down here is thick with the metallic smell of ozone and a throbbing ache grows in your teeth,
"Each step down the narrow, winding tunnel takes you deeper and closer to… what?",
"But you have come this far, and you cannot help but feel a surge of determination at being so close to the end of your search",
It is so close now,
The call is almost too much to bear,
Embla touches her forehead and for a moment seems to sway,
Are you unwell?,
But there is but one way to cure it now,
We must proceed,
Embla straightens,
Driina’s eyes narrow,
This place is not for us,
"The deeper we go, the further I feel we are from the Golden Light",
We must go on!,
"Surely, we must go on?",
Iben insists with an uncharacteristic intensity,
We press on,
#PrioryEnterFirstFloor,
"The heavy wooden doors swing open slowly on ancient, rusted hinges and you apprehensively step inside the darkened halls of the grim edifice",
"Inside, you find the air thick with dust and particles of swirling matter and your eyes adjust slowly to the darkness",
There is more,
A strange feeling as if something is stirring in anticipation at your arrival,
Driina’s voice interrupts your train of thought,
This place is alien to me,
There is nothing here that marks this as an Imperial place of worship,
We must be on our guard,
Embla points ahead,
Lumerods,
They must have been set up by the Cabal expedition,
Perhaps we can find some clue as to what fate befell them?,
I’ll tell you what befell them,
Roland growls,
"Nothing good, is what",
#PrioryGanglion1,
"A large, pulasting sack grows from the side of the fungal infection",
There is something inside it,
Cut it open,
Leave it,
"To your disgust and horror, a rotting corpse riddled with fungi spills forth",
"As it does, it drops a small journal",
You pocket the book and move on,
#PrioryGroundsEnter,
You enter the courtyard of the walled priory only to find it eerily quiet and surprisingly temperate,
Not even in Vauul are the Imperial gardens still heated in the winter,
"It is a sad thing to see for an Empire that was built on the subjugation of climate by man and magi, no?",
The nearly imperceptible humming felt through the ground tells that an ancient environmental ward is miraculously still active,
Truly a lost wonder of Imperial magical engineering,
Strange vegetation bursts out of the ground in grotesque mockeries of trees and writhing tendrils of fleshy pseudopods creep obscenely forth from the well,
"As you approach, the tentacles creep slowly but greedily in your direction",
Driina stomps the nearest tendril,
That blasted infestation seems to grow like a cancer throughout these isles!,
"Wherever we set foot, we find it festering in some dark corner",
she spits in disgust,
"Mesmerized, you allow it to slowly begin winding up your leg",
A wave of disgust washes over you to snap you out of your reverie and you hurriedly step away,
"Embla, what is that thing?",
It’s the fungi from outside,
"It infests Warda, growing through the veil and into the very matter of the world",
Her voice drops to a whisper,
It’s the herald of the Dragon,
The tentacles squirm with increased fervor at the very mention of that blasted name,
Stop it!,
Embla seems frozen in fear for a moment before she nods weakly in agreement,
You both feel it,
The horrid certainty that seven terrible eyes are now fixed on you,
"Driina grabs your arm, her face a determined mask",
There are some things we must not discuss here,
#PrioryInteriorAmbush,
"As you pass through the ancient library, you cannot help but be awestruck by the number and age of the assembled volumes",
Surely there are texts here that exist nowhere else in the Empire,
It’s a melancholy thought,
This priory is a time-capsule to an age that is long past and you cannot help but linger for a moment on all that has been lost over the long centuries of steady decline,
You draw out a random volume and examine it: ‘On the Reticular Properties of Salts’,
"As you turn the beautifully bound volume over in your hands, you stop",
Did you just see something move in the shadows?,
You squint into the darkness and see only rows and rows of books,
"Then, you see it again",
It’s as if reality itself ripples,
To your horror you realize that you are surrounded by a pack of some kind of chameleonic horrors!,
#PrioryInteriorSpottedCamp,
"Crates of supplies, camp equipment and mining gear litter this room",
It appears you’ve found the Cabal expedition’s base-camp,
I wonder what happened to them all?,
Kat muses,
and what they left behind,
She absent-mindedly kicks an empty sack,
The camp appears abandoned in a hurry and you wonder if the expedition may have left behind clues as to their fate,
Your eyes fall on the floor,
It’s covered by an intricate mosaic so life-like in its execution that the figures seem to shift,
You stand mesmerized,
Embla hisses,
Did you hear something?,
Look here,
The floor,
"Drinna walks into the chamber, kicking away dust from the intricate mosaic that is laid out before you",
"The imagery, there’s something wrong with it",
Shh!,
Embla interrupts,
"Out of the shadows, grotesque forms lumber towards you",
These are not the desiccated forms of the ancient dead but fresh corpses swollen with squirming tentacles of the Fungi from Outside,
I’d wager we’ve found the expedition’s members!,
Roland snarls as he braces to receive the onslaught,
I seems you’ve found the expedition’s members,
#PrioryOpenFakeTomb,
A cursory examination of the area reveals nothing,
"Nonetheless, your instinct tells you there is something here",
You’ll need to examine the chamber inch by inch,
You close your eyes and for a moment all is still,
Then you feel it,
The faintest of drafts seems to be coming from the south-west corner of the chamber,
There is no doubt,
There is another way out of here,
My faith in the Golden Dead is unfailing and it screams at me that something here is not as it seems,
But we’ve come this far and now that we stand before the tomb I say we get to the bottom of this charade,
"Embla, what about you?",
Open the tomb,
It still becons me,
Though… standing here now something feels off,
"Nonetheless, as I see it there is only one way forward",
We must open the tomb,
"Driina, how about you?",
The golden tomb stands before you in all its glory,
"Have you arrived, at last, at the object of your quest?",
"Embla, what are you thinking?",
"Driina, what do you think?",
It could be worse I suppose,
Kat adds as she pats your shoulder,
It could have been a trap,
But where to now?,
Scanning the room you can’t help but agree with Embla,
There is something about this chamber,
The taint of ancient secrets,
"Suddenly a massive portcullis slams down behind you and to your horror, thick greenish smoke billows into the chamber through unseen apertures",
"Oh, that’s not good!",
Kat says as her eyes widen in terror,
"If you do not find a way out of here, this will very quickly end up as your tomb as well",
You brace yourself and push with all your strength but find that the lid slides back easily and locks into position with a slight click,
It’s as if the lid has been designed to open and close,
"Nonetheless, the sarcophagus’ content now lies before you",
Look inside,
You draw a collective gasp as the content is revealed,
Nothing - The sarcophagus is utterly empty,
Roland’s laughter booms through the tomband you can hear Driina offer a whispered prayer of relief,
"Embla, somehow, looks less than surprised",
Roland’s laughter booms through the tomb,
Nothing but dust has ever lain hereand you can hear Driina offer a whispered prayer of relief,
Nothing but dust has ever lain here,
What is this?,
A false tomb,
A decoy perhaps?,
Like a chest with a false bottom?,
I suspect the true meaning of this tomb lies deeper than we first suspected,
Embla muses,
There is something we’ve missed,
Some hidden secret,
#PrioryPuzzleStatue0,
You slowly rotate the statue until it faces east,
You feel certain the action of rotating this statue is somehow significant but at the moment no wider effect or change can be observed,
Rotate statue towards the north,
Rotate statue towards the east,
Rotate statue towards the south,
Rotate statue towards the west,
You stand before a finely crafted statue of polished stone,
"As you examine it more closely, you realize that the statue is mounted on a rotating base",
With some effort you could turn it to face one of the cardinal directions,
You slowly rotate the statue until it faces north,
You slowly rotate the statue until it faces south,
The ground trembles as the sound of shifting stone reverberates throughout the complex,
Something large has moved - or perhaps opened?,
You slowly rotate the statue until it faces west,
#PrioryPuzzleStatue1,
#PrioryPuzzleStatue2,
#PrioryPuzzleStatue3,
#PrioryShipEntrance,
"As you approach the portal, a humming once more fills the air and strange, arcane sigils light up across its metallic skin",
"As if reinvigorated by the resurgent energies filling the cave, the mangled piles of the fungi-worm things littered around you begin to knit together and reassemble",
"Roland sits slumped against the wall next to you, breathing heavily",
You best get that door open afore those things come at us again,
I don’t think I can hold them for long,
Time is running out,
"Tremors once more shake the cave and before your eyes, the gigantic Herald-thing re-knits itself together before rising up to even greater heights than before",
It sways momentarily and then lets out an ear piercing scream,
"Around it, untold multitudes of fresh minor horrors rise forth",
We have to go!,
Emblas shout cuts through the din,
Run towards the portal,
The portal shifts,
Disassembling itself into its component panels like some strange flower opening its petals to welcome the Sun,
"Soft, lambent light bathes you as the portal opens, revealing an interior of bizarre geometries and utterly alien proportions",
An odd thought enters your mind,
Home,
"Instinctively, you and Embla's hands find each other",
There is no turning back now,
The final chapter has begun,
Venture Forth,
Clasping hands you pull the massive brute to his feet,
He winces in pain and a cough sprays blood down his chest,
Don’t worry about me,
Roland offers a sad smile,
"For the first time, you notice the stain bleeding through his tunic and armor",
Surely this is no issue given the right magics?,
Examine the wound,
You apprehensively lift his tunic to reveal his abdomen,
A large gash rimmed by necrotic skin,
And worse yet,
"Pushing out of the wound from within, are thick squirming tentacles",
I think this is as far as I go,
"Besides, where you’re heading, I suspect you won’t need me",
Roland painfully gets to his feet,
I'm not leaving you!,
Young fool,
I can only buy you seconds,
Roland clasps the back of your neck and pulls you in until your foreheads touch,
No more words are necessary,
"He lifts his weapon and turns, broad-legged and defiant, to face the onslaught of slavering jaws",
Roland!,
The soft touch of Embla’s hand on your elbow snaps you out of it,
"{PLAYER}, we have to go",
Don’t let his sacrifice be for naught!,

# Chapter_4_TowerOfAsh,

#CaliperoScene,
My loyal apprentices,
Their joy in life is to serve,
"And they do serve me well, don’t you think?",
He pats one of them on the cheek only to have the man’s nose start bleeding profusely,
They are a bit tired however,
My absence has been a burden on them,
I know how you repay these poor things,
Calipero’s face twists into a cruel smile,
"Thankfully, my ‘sons’ do not have the capacity to question my actions",
Their greatest joy in life is serving their master and their ‘ascension’ is the greatest reward their limited minds can imagine,
You're deranged,
I'll have none of this,
"So, it was you who came to the aid of Calipero the Tempestuous",
I will say this much,
You have done me a great service,
"For that, I am eternally grateful",
Here is a small token,
He gestures to one of his ‘apprentices’ who limps over to you and reverently hands you a large sack filled with coin,
But there is more to you,
Calipero muses,
"You are a traveler of sorts, yes?",
Someone on a quest?,
I may have much to offer you yet in terms of aid,
You cannot help but notice that his gaze lingers for a moment too long on Embla standing behind you,
What kind of aid?,
I went there - dancing across the silver-void,
I saw only shadows but I saw enough,
There are secrets in the deep,
Ancient secrets,
Enough to draw the Seven Eyes there,
That is all I can say,
Whatever do you need?,
I'd like to buy some items from you,
About your apprentices,
What happened in the summoning chamber?,
What do you know about the Black Priory?,
Welcome back to the 'Tower of Ash',
"Please, use my facilities as your own",
I'd like to trade with you,
Calling forth that which lies beyond is no task for a lesser Magos,
"However, I am not a lesser Magos",
The Aether serves at my will and there are very few secrets that the veil can keep from me,
"Alas, it was not so this time",
What answered my call was something different,
Something much more powerful than I expected,
What went wrong?,
Calipero fixes you with an intense stare,
The conjunction is growing in strength. ‘It’ is much closer to our world,
So close in fact that it has begun to seep through,
But you already know this don’t you?,
His gaze shifts to Embla,
You're talking about the Dragon,
The apprentices howl in terror and cover their ears,
Its seven eyes are fixed on the Outer Isles,
Something has been found that was perhaps never intended to see the light of day again,
That is why you are traveling to the Black Priory,
What can you tell me about the Black Priory?,
Certainly,
My vaults hold countless wonders for you to peruse,
His eyes glint in a way that does not appear wholly natural,
#MercuryPool,
A single clear note rings out and for a moment the chirping of exotic birds dies down,
Somewhere a metallic clang sounds and then the mercury begins to circle some unseen drain,
Slowly but surely steps come into view,
"With a final gurgle, the last of the liquid is drained away and at the end of the descending stairways a door can now be seen",
The ‘down below’ awaits,
The strange pool ahead of you is filled with a silvery fluid that looks like liquid metal,
Mercury perhaps?,
Play the Silver Flute,
#TowerOfAshElevator,
The elevator stands ready to take you up to the upper level of the dungeon,
Ascend,
The plate set into the floor bobs slightly as you step onto it,
It appears to be a kind of elevator leading down to the level below,
#WizardDungeonAlchemyBench,
The device hums with life and you get the impression it’s ready for use,
Craft the Salts of Elthanyr,
"Taking great care to place the ingredients into the catalyzer in the correct order, the process of transmutation begins",
Loud mechanical noises and hisses of steam sound as the machine vibrates violently,
Then to your amazement a beaker emerges - filled with a cerulean substance that no doubt is the Salts of Elthanyr,
Take the salts,
It seems you have done what Calipero asked you to do,
Now you must make your way down into the summoning chamber and prepare to face whatever you find there,
This appears to be some form of exotic alchemical crafting device,
"However, at the moment it appears to be somehow inactive",
#WizardDungeonCloneRoom,
The pathetic creatures howl in rage and terror and around them flickering reticular energies begin to form!,
"A handful of naked forms flail about the room, attacking with their bare hands the strange machines that fill it",
Their eyes are wild and staring and they drool as they bleat forth their non-verbal cries of fear and rage,
Suddenly they spot you and as one they freeze in place with a mask of terror on their face,
Look at these machines!,
This is where he… creates these poor creatures?,
They must have escaped when their master somehow failed to attend to them,
Born into a world comprised solely of this subterranean nightmare,
Embla looks around in wonder,
But that means,
They’re like children?,
Kat adds,
Go!,
Get out of here!,
Let's put them out of their misery!,
"Wild eyed and confused, the pathetic creatures first hesitate and then, in a sudden burst of mad energy, bolt towards the exit to the overworld",
Bah!,
What chance do they stand out there?,
Better we had put them to the sword and saved them their misery,
Roland scoffs,
"As they flee, you cannot help but wonder what chance they stand out there",
The feral apprentices seem less than intimidated by your display and instead a certain predatory aspect creeps into their stances,
It occurs to you that they might not have eaten in a while,
#WizardDungeonDrainage,
Bracing your back against the wall of the chute you attempt to make a controlled descent,
It proves more difficult than you had hoped however and you lose your grip and plummet into the dark cave below,
"You splash roughly into a shallow pool of water and though the landing has shaken you, at least you’re still alive",
Bracing your back against the wall of the chute you make a controlled descent until the chute emerges into a larger natural cavern,
A short drop remains but as the floor below is covered with water you take the chance and successfully drop into the chamber,
A large drain is set into the floor,
"Though you cannot tell where the chute beyond leads, you could easily fit in should you dare",
Climb Down,
#WizardDungeonElevatorBlocked,
The room ahead of you contains a large stone platform that appears to be hovering in some kind of shaft leading down,
"As you take your first step into the room however, the voice of Calipero booms throughout the chamber",
You’ve not crafted the Salts of Elthanyr!,
You cannot enter the summoning chamber without it!,
Don’t tarry - I can’t hold much longer!,
#WizardDungeonGenerator,
The strange machine appears to hum with latent energy,
It appears to have been damage by the strange fire-creatures that occupied the room but you think you could probably reactivate it through some trial and error,
Reactivate it,
The droning hum coming from the machine rises in pitch and a subtle vibration can be felt through the floor now,
"You believe you’ve reactivated this device, though to what end you’re not certain",
Strange creatures seemingly composed of fire and molten lava stand around a large arcane machine of some sort,
They appear to be swaying and you almost get the impression they’re drawing energy from the machine; almost as if feeding upon it,
One of the creatures suddenly appears to notice you,
One by one they turn to face you,
It seems they are protective of their food-source,
The machine hums along with a low drone that reverberates throughout the dungeon,
There is nothing more for you to do here,
#WizardDungeonQuest1,
I’ve not heard of these Salts of Elthanyr before,
"If we find his laboratory, perhaps we can find a recipe of sorts?",
"Nonetheless, I say we press on and do what we can to aid this man",
As I’ve said before,
A Magos is not an ally to scoff at,
I cast my voice into your mind from my summoning chamber - deep beneath your feet,
I have become… detained there and it shall be your privilege to render your assistance in freeing me!,
And how did you end up so detained?,
Through certain rites I was calling up that which lies beyond,
"What came through however, was not… what I expected",
It tried to overpower me but I was faster,
By my immense willpower alone am I keeping my foe at bay,
I can hold him for a long time - but not forever,
But what can I do?,
The voice sounds strained now,
I need,
I need Salts of Elthanyr,
It can be created in my laboratory,
You just need the three ingredients,
Find,
The voice cuts out,
Find what?!,
Just craft the Salts of Elthanyr and bring them to the summoning chamber below!,
Hurry,
Cannot ho,
What do you make of it Embla?,
As you walk past the statue in the corridor a voice suddenly rings out from it,
"Sharp and terrible, like two metal bars being clanged together, it seems to resonate in your very bones",
Interloper!,
You stand in the halls of Calipero the Tempestuous!,
Serve me well and I shall forgive you your transgression,
Are... are you inside the statue?,
Serve you?,
What makes you think I want to serve you?,
I am no statue!,
You are talking to none other than,
Calipero the Tempestous!,
Once the court-master to the High Wizard of Freymark,
But where are you talking to me from?,
And what makes you think I want to assist you?,
Insolent mortal!,
You shall serve because I ask it of you!,
Besides,
I’ll pay well,
Just pay attention!,
My grip is failing!,
What's happening?,
#WizardDungeonRecipeBook,
"The large book appears to be a collection of different, obscure alchemical recipes",
Flipping through it you eventually find the entry for ‘Salts of Elthanyr’,
Read the Recipe,
Summoning forth that which dwells beyond is one of the most dangerous tasks that a Magos can undertake,
What comes through may not always be what was intended,
The Salts of Elthanyr must always be kept at hand when attempting such rituals,
It is antithetical to that which has been called forth,
Strewing it in a circle around the summoning focus confines the outsider,
Casting the salts upon the outsider utterly unmakes it,
The salts are difficult to create and may only be crafted in a Protoplasmic Catalyzer,
Three ingredients must be used and added in this precise order,
First add Sylversalt,
"Second, add Salamander’s Horn",
"Finally, add Lotus Petals",
#WizardDungeonSarcophagus,
You examine the sarcophagus as best you can but fail to make much sense of its purpose beyond it not appearing to be used for burial,
Pressing down on the bottom of the interior it appears to give ever so slightly - almost as if it was hinged in some way,
Taking a step back you scan the area around the sarcophagus only to spot a stone tile that is polished almost smooth by years of wear,
No doubt this is a switch of some sort,
Press the switch,
"In the middle of this room stands a large golden sarcophagus-like chest that is richly engraved with complex, arcane-looking symbols",
Carved in beautiful letters on a lid of the sarcophagus is the following,
"For thy service to thy Lord, Ascension is thy sweet reward",
Open it,
Examine the decorations,
The lid of the sarcophagus slides open with surprising ease revealing an interior molded to the form of a human form,
"All along the interior walls, more of the strange looking sigils are carved giving the sarcophagus the appearance of being some sort of ‘machine’",
"Carefully pressing down on the switch with your foot, the effect is immediate",
"The false bottom of the sarcophagus swings to one side, opening up to a shaft below",
"As soon as it does, scorching jets of flame roar up the shaft",
Had someone been laying in the sarcophagus they would have been totally and utterly incinerated,
Reduces to ash in an instance,
Driina’s eyes go wide with shock,
Is this how those apprentices are repaid for their servitude?,
He uses them and then disposes of them like leprous corpses when they can serve no more?,
What monster could do such a thing?!,
You shudder at the implication,
How many of this man’s ‘apprentices’ have ended their life in this way?,
The symbols carved into the sarcophagus appear to be magical in nature,
"Beyond that however, you have no idea of their meaning or purpose",
"At first glance, the symbols carved into the sarcophagus appear to be magical in nature",
"This however, is only at first glance",
Further examination reveals that they are nothing but purely decorative patterns of no arcane significance,
"In fact, you feel certain that the gold-leaf covering the structure is fake as well",
#WizardDungeonSummoningChamber1,
Howling winds scream through these halls,
Though you feel it clawing at your exposed skin there is something strange about it,
A ghost wind,
Only partially of the material world,
The other half coming from beyond,
No doubt Calipero’s summoning chamber lies ahead,
#WizardDungeonSummoningChamberFinal,
You fling the vial of salt at the horrid creature but a gust of that terrible witch-wind catches the bottle instead,
It misses its mark and shatters against the wall and the Salts of Elthanyr spread into the roiling vortex,
Each grain that strikes the pillar of smokes explodes into a tiny shower of sparks but it does not have the intended effect,
Instead something roars in the beyond and in an explosion of white light Calipero’s ward collapses,
You have failed your quest,
The howling witch-winds rise as you push south into what must be the summoning chamber,
Emerging from the central pool is a great whirling plume of black smoke,
"Bluish light flashes inside it like lightning and, for a few mercifully brief moments, illuminates something vast swimming inside the smoke",
"The thing claws at the threshold of reality, desperate to break through - like a drowning man trapped under the thinnest of ice-sheets",
Standing in front of the hideous thing is a single robed human figure,
Calipero no doubt,
"Encased in some glimmering sphere of force, Calipero’s form is utterly frozen in time",
"Nonetheless, his statue-like form conveys superhuman effort",
He has held the monstrosity from beyond at bay this long but his grip is no doubt failing,
Throw the salt at the pillar of smoke,
The man who stands before you looks much like his apprentices,
Or perhaps it is more accurate to say they look a lot like him for no doubt this is the original,
"He regards you with cold eyes, head slightly cocked to one side, but says nothing",
You open your mouth to speak and he snaps his fingers,
A rush of air and sudden vertigo and then you are somewhere else,
"You fling the vial at the pillar of black smoke and watch in awe as the salt ignites, turning the pillar from a pillar of smoke to a pillar of multi-colored flame instead",
Something screams in terror from beyond,
At first the roar of some great beast then the whimper of a child,
"Then, suddenly, all is quiet and the thing is no more",
You reel from the shock of the unmaking and for a moment your vision is obscured by the bright afterimages of the arcane light,
"Slowly, your eyesight readjusts to the now darkened chamber and you see the Magos rising slowly to his feet",
Calipero I presume?,
#WizardsTowerEnter,
You mind reels as you look around the lush interior of the tower,
"Colorful, fragrant flowers abound and exotic songbirds sing in every bush",
"Stranger still, the tower’s interior is somehow much larger than its exterior seems to allow",
Kat looks around in awe,
This place is… impossible,
I wonder what hands could have shaped such beauty?,
"No doubt this is the work of some Magos, yes?",
Let’s not be blinded by the splendor,
Iben muses as he carefully prods at one of the orchids with his weapon,
"Looking around, You cannot help but wonder what hands could have shaped such beauty",
#WizardTowerQuestBegin,
Embla strokes her chin,
The scent of the Reticulum is about this,
I would wager much that this ‘Master’ he speaks of is a sorcerer of sorts,
A Magos even,
"Though time is against us, another Magos could be a powerful ally and our path to Gradla takes us past Eryll in any case",
"I say, we should at least investigate this further",
Let's be on our way for now,
"From his skin and nails to his jaundiced eyes and missing teeth, this young man appears to have been stricken by some disease",
"Beyond that, you’ve never seen anything quite like it and have no idea how to classify it",
"So, what is this about your master then?",
"From his skin and nails to his jaundiced eyes and missing teeth, the young man’s condition is perplexing",
Some of these symptoms are similar to those suffered by Magi upon exposure to strong magics over time but this is far too severe - especially considering the man’s young age,
It’s as if he’s quite literally falling apart in front of your eyes,
"Strangest of all, it appears as if the man is oblivious to his condition",
"Traveling north along the coast, you notice a young man standing at the side of the road",
"His tattered robes, bald head and unhealthy pallor reminds you of a magos, though this boy is surely too young?",
He follows your passing with an idiotic smile draped over his round bland face,
Can I help you?,
Ignore the man,
We have come,
he stops for a long moment and thinks,
to beg for aid!,
Our Master is missing down below and we are not allowed to enter and search for him,
Something is wrong - we know it!,
"A note of agitation, bordering on panic, creeps into his voice",
"Suddenly he stops, choughs slightly, and then smiles again",
Bloody drool runs down his chin along with one of the man’s teeth,
What of your master?,
Help!,
the young man croaks as you pass him,
He blinks as if he was equally surprised as you at the outburst - all the while smiling moronically,
Well!,
Speak up boy or you’ll get the back of my hand!,
Roland grumbles at the man,
We beseech you,
Travel to Eryll,
Seek out the Tower of Ash,
Find us there and learn of our Master’s fate,
"But please, time is of the essence and for each second you tarry, hope fades",
"The words flow as if rehearsed and then, as he speaks the last words he lets out a deep sigh and sits down on the ground",
Eryll?,
Tower of Ash?,
"Why, I’ve never felt better",
The man seems taken aback by the question,
"Please, it is my master who needs help",
Driinas eyes narrow as she grabs one of his hands with the skilled touch of a healer,
You’re not well at all,
she mumbles to herself,
Let me just take a look at you none the less,
His eyes are glassy and distant,
Find us there,
he repeats before his voice trails off,
Fool’s mind is gone,
He’ll be food for crows come nightfall and it’ll be a mercy,
Roland mumbles,
Are you just going to sit there?,
The man rolls over on his side - eyes staring stiffly ahead,
"Though he still appears to be alive, no prodding or prompting raises any kind of response from him",
There appears to be nothing more you can do for this lost soul save consider his request,
I'm not sure what ot make of this,
#WizardTowerTopFloor,
It is where our Master goes to do his sacred work,
But he is missing!,
"Please, you must go there now",
Find him,
Use the silver flute and go through the mercury lake!,
"And if I do, what's in it for me?",
I'll get going,
Master is still missing!,
Go down below now!,
The apprentices again begin to whimper in terror like caged animals,
You emerge into what appears to be an observatory of sorts,
Astronomical glyphs cover the floor and in the center of the room stands what appears to be a huge telescope,
"Strangely though, there does not appear to be any form of aperture in the roof that would allow it to observe the sky",
Four robed figures huddle together under the strange construct like frightened animals,
Come out so I can see you!,
Slowly the four figures creep forwards into the half-light and to your astonishment you see that all four have identical faces,
Indeed they all appear to be identical to the strange man you met on Idra,
You come for Master!,
"one of the men states, rather than asks, with a serene smile on his face",
What in the Magi’s Loins is going on here?,
Kat blurts out as she stares in fascinated awe at the quadruplets,
We are apprentices of Calipero the Tempestuous,
one of the others answers with a smile,
But… our Master if miffing!,
lisps an apprentice toothlessly,
"As one, the four men begin to whimper",
"Though all four men are identical, they all seem to be afflicted by varying degrees of the strange decomposition that you observed in their 'brother' on Idra",
Missing?,
Explain!,
Master has gone down below,
To his work,
But he has not returned!,
Something is wrong!,
Danger!,
DANGER!,
Like frightened animals the four apprentices fret anxiously about,
Down below?,
One of them whispers,
We’re not allowed to go there,
Not until we ascend,
But you can go!,
Even without ascending!,
As one the four apprentices’ moronic smiles return and they all nod in agreement,
You go now!,
How would I even get there?,
"One of the men pushes a small, silver flute into your hands",
This is the key,
Blow it and the mercury lake will open for you,
It’s where we go to ascend but we’re not allowed there without him!,
So you must go instead!,
Embla looks at the flute with fascination,
He must mean the mercury lake down on the ground floor,
The affairs of Magi indeed,
I wonder what knowledge a man such as this Calipero could be hiding in his secret halls?,
she muses,
Keep his knowledge for yourself Embla - I’d be happier with a fistful of diamonds,
Kat chimes in,
Let's try to get some answers first,
Let's be on out way then,
We serve Calipero the Tempestuous!,
all four answer in unison,
As kind and loving as he is wise - Our joy is to serve him until we one day ascend to join him in the ranks of the holy Magi!,
Ascend?,
But how come you all look so similar?,
"When we are judged ready, we go down below",
Under the mercury pool and into and enter the ascension chamber and the golden machine!,
There we shall transcend this weak flesh and take our place amongst those who are giants amongst men!,
What more can you tell me about the area below?,
The four apprentices stare at you with blank smiles,
Tell me about this master of yours!,
What kind of reward are we looking at here?,
What lies down below?,
This young man smiles serenely at you as you approach,
His round face is eerily identical to that of all of his ‘brothers’,
Where is Master?,
I'm still searching,
Our Master is rich beyond comparison!,
Beyond count will be the joys and gifts he will bestow upon you!,
The four apprentices simply smile absentmindedly as if they didn’t hear or understand the question,
After a short while one of them repeats,

#IagoWeatherMaiden,
May the wind be in our sails!,
Ask about JoinUs,
Something about JoinUs,
More about JoinUs,
Finally the last part about JoinUs,
"Ah! {PLAYER}, how goes it?",
I trust you are finding yourself at home on the Weathermaiden?,
I am indeed,
Excellent!,
I’ve told my gallant crew to be on their best behavior!,
"If there is nothing else, I must get back to planning our journey",
Iago gestures towards a pile of nautical charts and maps,
We'll talk later!,
How does the Maiden treat you?,
#ZharaWeathermaiden,
There is an oven going over on the fore-castle where you can cook your meals,
And before you ask,
The forecastle is at the front of the boat,
He’s around somewhere!,
Have you tried his cabin below?,
"If he's not there now, just keep checking in and you'll run into him eventually!",
Zhara expertly mans the helm while keeping a steady eye on the horizon,
She appears to revel in the fact that she’s back at sea and as she sees you she lets out a howl of joy,
By all of the Blind Maidens it is good to feel the wind on my face again!,
"This is the good life, no?",
Winds behind and adventure in front!,
Ah yes,
Argh!,
In the meantime I had some questions,
Not to worry!,
We’ve set aside a cabin for you down below - next to the captain's quarter,
Feel free to rest there and to store any items you might wish to,
"I can assure you, they’ll be quite safe!",
Nothing I'd rather do than answer your questions!,
I need to see the captain!,
I need to rest!,
Is there any place to cook my food?,
I wanted to ask you something!,

# Chapter_5_StarStriderShip,

#StarstriderShip_Awakening,
Darkness,
The feel of cold metal on bare skin,
A smell in the air,
"The pungent mix of spices, ozone and untold eons past",
"Consciousness eludes you however, and you slip back into the abyss",
…,
You dream of floating,
Of stars,
A blue orb wreathed in a shimmering veil,
But there is more; A rift!,
Something seeps through,
Like venom entering a wound,
Coiling,
Roiling,
Primordial,
Suddenly a scream of pain and terror cuts into your mind like an acid knife!,
"Shocked awake, the scream echoes in your mind",
Was it real or part of the dream?,
"Stirring slowly, you find you’re lying on some kind of table",
"You’re naked and cold and, as far as you can tell, all alone",
You stand up and find your head spinning,
"Even in the faint light, the vague outlines hint of proportions and dimension not meant for men",
What immortal hand could have framed such things?,
Perhaps the concealing darkness is a blessing to your wracked senses,
#StarstriderShip_Misc,
A strange membranous substance blocks the road ahead,
You suspect this may be some kind of door though there is no opening mechanism nearby,
#StarstriderShipConsole,
Something about Doors,
More about Doors,
The machine abides,
The inner doors have been unlocked,
Issue another query,
A discordant sound blears at you from the machine in what can only be described as contempt,
The aperture dies down and the machine appears to some sort of hibernation state,
The image is one of deep timeless sleep,
Millennias passing in silence,
Then a sound,
Something banging on the outer skin,
Children!,
They have descended from the trees and multiplied,
In their greed for knowledge and power they now come to disturb us,
But something else has crept in,
They have torn the veil!,
It is here now!,
It claws at our skin!,
We are holding for now but we grow weak,
The navigator must awaken,
"The longer you play with it, the more the strange sounds and images resonate with you",
You begin seeing them for what they are,
Terms in some great cosmic equation,
A language of pure logic,
No longer are the notes mere sounds,
With each note a number resonates,
"As if sensing your dawning understanding, the great machine offers you a prompt",
How do you respond?,
Enter '4',
Enter '5',
Enter '6',
The machine prompts you to enter the next number,
Enter '8',
Enter '10',
Enter '12',
The machine prompts you to enter the final number,
Enter '13',
Enter '14',
Enter '15',
The interior of the aperture appears like a churning vortex of some black oily substance,
"Within it motes of light appear, looking almost like miniature stars that are born and die within the span of moments",
Images form,
Strange geometric shapes that combine and recombine in strange infinite fractals,
"Looking around for a way to operate the strange machine, your hand passes over the liquid-filled basins",
A strangely musical note can be heard,
Soft at first and then much stronger as your fingers lightly graze the surface of the liquid,
"Dipping your fingers into the liquid at different points produces unique notes - almost like playing an instrument - and as you do so, the images on the aperture shift",
You find yourself mesmerized,
The auditory and visual patterns seem utterly incomprehensible and yet,
There is something there,
Something stirring in the back of your mind,
"A sonorous, polyphonic wave of equations issues forth from the aperture",
"Like a veil being lifted, you find that you now understand the machine’s language on an instinctual level",
"The aperture on the wall is strangely mesmerizing though at the present, you have a feeling it is somehow inactive",
You look over at the empty basins flanking it,
Perhaps they are involved somehow?,
The machine serves at your command,
Unlock the doors!,
What is the status of this place?,
The black surface vibrates in anticipation as you approach it,
Interact,
Something about Status,
More about Status,
Finally the last part about Status,
#StarstridershipConsolePools,
"Smooth, empty basins line the console",
Narrow grooves seem to connect them and you get a feeling that they’re part of some kind of machine,
"Whatever this is, it appears dormant at the moment and has likely been so for a long time",
Fill Basins,
"Carefully, you empty the fluid from the vessels into the basins",
"Seeming to move of its own volition, the fluid spreads from basin to basin through the inset grooves and slowly the entire room hums into life",
It appears you have conjured something back into life,
#StarstriderShipDriina,
The Driina’s whispered prayers echo softly throughout the strange hallway,
Over and over she recites the same lines as she rocks gently back and forth,
Driina!,
I tried to talk to her,
To make her see,
But it’s too late,
I couldn’t stop her,
Who?,
She is so close now,
He calls to her,
I really did try to stop her,
But I see now,
We have always come here - and we always will,
She will need your help before the end,
She lapses back into reciting her prayer,
There is nothing more to be done for her,
#StarstriderShipIben,
Your hands shake as you contemplate what you must do!,
"To release him, you must no doubt inflict more pain onto his tortured form",
"Fumbling, you reach into the open chest-cavity searching for his heart",
You find it but the feeling of it beating in your hands is enough to make you vomit,
"You try again, tears streaming down your face and, with much effort, you eventually manage to end his torment",
You control your breathing as best you can,
Iben is already gone - You’re just setting him free,
With deft hands you reach into the open chest cavity and find the still-beating heart,
You end his torment,
The scene ahead of you is one of utter horror frozen in time,
The form of a man utterly unmade with a master chirurgeon's precision,
And for what purpose?,
Cruelty perhaps?,
This body was taken apart by curious hands,
Like a child would pick apart some clever clockwork toy to get at the secrets within,
Murder to dissect,
Examine the body more closely,
Reluctantly you approach the mangled face of the corpse,
Disassembled into its anatomical component pieces it’s nonetheless familiar to you,
This is the corpse of Iben,
The man who fought so valiantly at your side through horrors untold,
There was no warrior’s death for him; just pain and terror,
Good bye old friend,
The corpse’s eyes open wide!,
"Impossibly, Iben is still alive",
The chirurgeon has taken great care to maintain the integrity of the circulatory system and for the first time you notice that the splayed body-parts are still connected by pulsating blood vessels!,
"Eyes stare at you in wordless terror and, no doubt, pain beyond measure!",
Do what must be done,
Dazed you stumble away from the horrid scene,
There is nothing more for you here now,
You must push ahead,
#StarstriderShipKat,
Movement catches your eye ahead,
Something small and pale,
Crouching like a frightened animal,
Your heart sinks as you see who it is,
Kat,
She throws herself at you and clings to you like a shivering child,
T-they took him!,
They did… they made h-him,
T-they took us!,
We’re powerless!,
The little men!,
They live in the walls!,
I saw them take us,
Stripped us down like beasts going to the butcher’s cleaver!,
They don’t sleep like he does,
They stay awake so he can sleep!,
Who do you mean?,
The king!,
The navigator,
He’s slept for so long but they say it’s time for him to wake up now,
They say they’re glad we came here,
We did good,
But I don’t believe them,
We should never have come!,
Gods walk these halls!,
We need to get out of here!,
Kat’s expression vacillates between a smile and sheer terror,
The little men say we can’t leave,
The king must awaken before the crawling doom finds its way inside,
She tilts her head slightly to one side as if hearing something,
And they say it’s time for me to go now,
I’m next,
She takes a step backwards,
Kat?,
"She holds your gaze, her smile almost apologetic, as she backs up against the wall",
The strange biomechanical material convulses and a fissure opens up,
"Half a dozen grotesque, small hands reach out and wrap around Kat!",
Before you have time to react she is pulled in and the fissure seals shut with a disgusting smack,
You are left dumbfounded and alone,
#StarstriderShipServitor,
The simulacra of a humanoid form stands before you,
Is this a machine imitating life or some living thing imitating a machine?,
"A strange, viscous liquid fills its cupped hands as if it’s offering it to you",
Fill Vessel,
The vessel slots into the machine-creature and fills liquid,
You take it back,
Perhaps this can be of some use?,
#StarstriderShipVaultEnter,
You stand in the halls of titans,
No man was ever meant to see this!,
Why did you come here?,
It was her wasn’t it?,
Or was it?,
Did you ever really have a choice?,
Was there some unseen hand driving you towards this doom?,
"Breathing fast and head reeling, your eyes fix on something utterly out of place in its mundanity",
A discarded shoe,
Look behind you,
You sense her before you see her,
A luminous phantom in the darkness,
Naked and emaciated there is nonetheless something in her bearing,
Acceptance?,
An aura of maternal comfort?,
She strokes your cheek,
Don’t be afraid,
We’re with him now,
What is happening?,
Look upon him,
She takes you by the hand and leads you to the base of the massive throne,
Stars flash before your eyes as you force yourself to look at the statue seated on it,
Or is it something… more?,
A sleeping king?,
A god!,
Your heart begins racing,
You cannot bear standing in its presence,
Embla begins laughing as tears stream down her face,
"A tremor violently shakes the structure and you feel, more than hear, an otherworldly scream coming from somewhere outside",
Embla’s eyes are wide,
I must do what I was summoned here for and you must help me,
Help you do what?,
The King must awaken before the Dragon reaches him,
He’s slept for so long and there is so little of his essence left,
He needs fresh life,
The glass sarcophagus opens as Embla approaches,
To your amazement you see that the inside is molded to perfectly fit a human form,
The dire implications of the device are unmistakable,
It can't end like this!,
I'm supposed to take you to your father!,
Don’t you understand?,
She smiles sadly,
I’m already with my father,
She softly strokes your cheek,
I’ve always come here and you’ve always brought me,
Time and time again we’ve stood here - in this place,
And every time you do the right thing,
That is the entirety of my universe now,
Him in front - you behind,
But you'll die!,
All things die,
But I’ll be with him,
I wonder if I will look out from behind his eyes?,
"Slowly and painfully, Embla hoists herself onto the rim of the sarcophagus",
With much effort she swings her legs up and lies down in the device,
Her body seems to have aged years just since you entered the chamber but now a look of utter relief washes over her face,
The machine emits an oddly beautiful note,
A ritual has begun and it is time for you to take your part,
Interact with the machine,
A torrent of resonant wave-form logic floods into you and the machine now awaits your command,
Commence the ritual,
A huge tremor once again shakes the craft,
The howl that sounds this time is much more forceful,
Something is about to breach the craft’s outer hull,
Embla half-open eyes remain fixed on you as you feed the machine the harmony that sets the ritual in motion,
The faintest trace of a smile plays across her lips,
"Snaking tendrils emerge from holes in the machine, seeking out the body encased within",
She jolts as they plunge into her flesh,
For a moment she is quiet then she breaks out into violent spasms,
The machine begins to whir and the tendril-plugs pulsate obscenely with peristaltic motion,
It has begun!,
Let the ritual proceed,
The room shakes violently,
Light streaming from the anti-womb into the sleeping King as Embla is utterly unmade,
He who sat undying for eons stirs!,
HE RISES!,
You are but an insect at the feet of gods,
All is darkness,

An old man looks you carefully up and down as if evaluating some farm animal,
You find him somewhat unnerving,
"Decrepit as he appears, there is nonetheless some unnatural vitality upon him",

"Why, I’m examining you",
There is something about you,
A sheen of sorts,
Something in your past - or perhaps your future?,

That is indeed the question” the man answers obtusely,
He squints and strokes his beard as if trying to remember some long lost memory,
You may call me Malachai,

A pilgrim's shrine,
Driina answers as she thoughtfully strokes the ancient masonry,
There are a number of these spread throughout the Outer Isles,
Pilgrims would come from throughout the Empire to pray at them,
It is said to bring good luck and clarity,
But you have not visited them?,
I’m a Sepulchite,
My order is not required to do pilgrimages and I’ve had little time to wander in my time here,
"That being said, it would give me great joy to be able to visit all the shrines one day",
"Say, pilgrims traveling to the shrines pass through Horryn",
We might still find some there,
Perhaps they could teach us the proper prayers and rituals to perform at these sites?,
Yes let's keep an eye out for them,
"An ancient, weathered Imperial way-shrine stands before you",
Despite its remote location you suspect it still sees occasional use,
Pray at the shrine,
"Driina, what is this?",
Examine the shrine,
You are a bit rusty on your Imperial religious history and have no clue as to the way-shrine’s purpose,
This is one of several pilgrim sites in the Outer Isles,
It is said that to pray at them offers wholeness of body and clarity of mind,
"However, you have no idea of the proper prayers and rituals to perform",
Perhaps there are pilgrims in the region for you to ask?,
You kneel by the way-shrine and begin to recite the pilgrim’s prayer,
You successfully complete the ritual,
