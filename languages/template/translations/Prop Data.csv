The web of some giant arachnid,
#Inspectables,
The piece of paper seems to contain a work order,
"and as can clearly be observed, the tunnel’s support pillar is close to giving in",
"If this last piece of support was to be removed, it is highly likely that the tunnel would collapse completely",
continue the previous day’s work of expanding the tunnel eastwards,
I believe you should be very close to breaking through,
Doing so will allow us to create a short-cut to the mine’s entrance and I don’t need to tell you how much this would improve logistics,
Barricade,
A barricade constructed from debris blocks this path,
It is too large to dismantle before retaking the city and for now you must find some way around it,
Cave In,
A portion of the cave has collapsed behind you,
There is no going back this way,
Spider Corpse,
The mauled corpse of a giant spider,
Grave,
A fresh grave with a simple marker made of sticks,
No name can be found upon it,
The corpse belongs to a graying old man,
His face is serene and there is nothing to indicate he did not die of natural causes,
"Leaning over the body however, you spot thin strands of some bizarre purplish fungal growth protruding from the man's mouth and nose",
"Strange vines of some unknown, purplish growth bursts forth from the masonry",
"As you lean in, fine strands reach greedily towards you",
You recoil in disgust and decide it’s best to not touch the growths,
Dead Body,
A body lies broken upon the ground,
"Though it has been gnawed by hounds, it seems clear that this person fell or jumped from the cliffs above",
Old Crates,
Old and ruined shipping crates litter this part of the cave,
Only smugglers would use a place like this to store their goods,
"Perhaps there are other, similar caches to be found on the Outer Isles?",
A Note,
A note is scrawled in crude letters,
Kook!,
I cannot stand another meal of Salted Fish!,
"There is a limet to how long a man can live on salt, potatoes and perklin",
"Take head, or git a dagger in the eye ye cheap basterd",
Strange Jar,
An oddly shaped container of some unknown design,
"The surface is smooth and metallic, but not of a material you recognize",
"Though the artifact is without a scratch, it still somehow conveys impossible age",
Librarian’s Journal,
A book lies open on the librarian’s desk,
"Brother Auran has once again made off with the key to the forbidden section, claiming it is ‘much more convenient for both me and him’ that he keeps it for the duration of his studies",
He’s assured me it’s well hidden in his study in the eastern tower whilst not in use,
Bloody fool,
I’ll need to send lay-brother Theo to recover it next time Auran is sleeping,
Sea-Caves,
The sea-caves lie abandoned and closed off,
Scribbled in a shaky hand on ancient parchment is the following verse,
Walk the path in humble fate Contemplate the hidden gate,
Let the watchers show the way Like time flows ‘round the wheel of day,
To heed the silent sleepers call And enter into the Dreaming Hall,
Ink and Paper,
Ink and paper that appears to have been abandoned mid-use,
It seems someone was copying the mosaic on the floor,
Grotesque Relief,
The sarcophagus has the following description,
Carroleth the Manyfaced - First Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
Rothrax the Gray - Second Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
Kalamar the Wise - Third Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
Secret Passage,
The relief of this altarpiece seems to shift and squirm in the dancing light,
"What’s more, there appears to be a hidden passage behind it",
No way of opening it can be seen nearby,
Pile of Ash,
This cave opens up into the sheer cliff wall beneath the tower,
Piled on the ledge is a great heap of ash that the wind occasionally carries away in great wisps,
Carefully you prod the pile only to find a small handful of scorched human bones and teeth,
"Looking around, you see a great in the ceiling above from which the ash appears to have been dumped",
"A large square slab with small holes carved in it appears to be placed over some sort of shaft, sealing it shut",
You attempt to look through one of the holes but are knocked back by an unbearable stench emitting from below,
But wait?,
Was there something else?,
Movement?,
The slab seems too heavy to lift and just as well,
You have an overwhelming feeling that what is trapped in the shaft below was not meant for mortal eyes to see and is best left in the dark,
A Desk,
A desk with a maritime navigation map,
The map is labled 'The Outer Isles' and a course is drawn towards an island named 'Idra',
A Grisly Scene,
You recognize the corpse of one of the crew-mates,
A young man of barely 16 years called Sullum,
The youth has been mauled to death by what you assume are the grotesquely altered rats you encounterd just minutes ago,
The corpse is still warm,
