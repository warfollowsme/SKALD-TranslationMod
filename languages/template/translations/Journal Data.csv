#Chapter 0,
Man Over Board,
Roland fell overboard,
An Old Boar,
"I encountered one of my father’s old friends, Kydeon, at the Berryn estate",
It was good to see the old boar again,
Waking up,
I woke up in the hold of the Zephyr to find something is wrong on the ship,
#Chapter 1,
A Foul Cave,
I discovered a cave near the spot where I landed on Idra,
A foul stench of rotting flesh and seaweed lies thick inside,
Driina the Sepulchite,
I was joined by a Sepulchite cleric by the name Driina,
She intends to search for a way into the city of Horryn which has apparently been overrun by cultists,
"Before we leave the camp, she insists we make a stop by the camp’s de-facto leader",
Someone named Markus who is holed up in a stable nearby,
A Floating Corpse,
I found a lost soul in the underwater cave system under the lighthouse,
The poor wretch must have gotten lost in the darkness and drowned,
I must take care I do not share his fate,
There was a key on the corpse,
Embla in Horryn,
Frantzo the former innkeeper just told me that Embla stayed at his inn in Horryn in the days leading up to the calamities that saw the city overrun,
The Gates are Sealed,
I searched for a way into Horryn but had little luck,
"For now, it seems I must carve out some other way of surviving on this barren island until an opportunity presents itself",
"Till then, the island no doubt overflows with desperate wretches in need of assistance",
"Till then, Driina suggests we must return to the refugee camp and do all we can to aid them in their desperate plight",
A Ritual Dagger,
I recovered a strange dagger of indeterminate age from the underwater caves beneath the lighthouse on Idra,
It appears to have been a form of ritual implement and I suspect it might still hold both significance and power,
Astronomer's Journal,
I found a strange journal that seems to have belonged to an Imperial astronomer,
"It appears the poor man felt the stars are somehow ""wrong"" after spotting a strange star-cluster in the southeastern quadrant",
A Feast for Lizards,
I found scraps of rotting flesh in the lizard-cave on Idra,
I wonder if the reptiles would gorge themselves if they had more flesh?,
Goat Gold,
"Jakub the farmer, paid me a small bribe to keep quiet about his hidden goats",
Jakub is Done Talking,
"Jakub, the Idran goat farmer, has made it clear he has nothing more to say regarding the issue of his hidden goats",
The Gravedigger,
I met a poor fellow outside the Idran refugee camp,
Ha had the thankless task of burying dead refugees,
I offered to help him before the horrid entities that roam the island made short work of him,
"Needless to say, he didn’t think twice",
The Hidden Glen,
I learned the way to a hidden glen near the refugee camp on Idra,
The best way to get there is to find and follow the goat tracks behind the old goat enclosure on Jakub’s farm,
A Survivor,
I found a sailor named Andry cowering in the foul caves near my landing site on Idra,
He thanked me profusely for the help and made his way out to look for fellow survivors,
The Lighthouse,
I made it to the lighthouse and met its keeper Mathias,
A haggard old fellow that had barricaded himself on the top floor of the structure,
"To his credit, he’s managed to keep the lighthouse running throughout the calamities that are befalling this island",
No doubt this is critical to the survival of those still caught out at sea,
The second keeper,
The lighthouse in Idra seems to have had a second keeper,
A man named Caspar who seemingly went mad dreaming about caves underneath the lighthouse,
His writing mentions a “blade” calling him there,
Monoliths,
There are strange monoliths on Idra,
"Though they appear to be ancient, it seems someone is still performing rituals at them",
Surviving Sailors,
I came across a group of survivors from the Zephyr,
"They were hold up in some abandoned fishing huts and their leader, Snow, asked that I send any other survivors from the Zephyr to their camp",
The Telescope,
"Though I cannot really put into words what I saw, I used the astronomer’s telescope and I saw terrible things",
I am beset by a deep certainty that something is gravely wrong on this island,
The Weathermaiden's Plight,
A crewman from the ship “Weathermaiden” has asked that I seek out the first mate Zhara,
They are holed up in a large sea-cave at position 66 by 91 on the Outer Isles map,
That should make it north-west of the refugee-camp,
An Abandoned Farm,
I came across a small abandoned farm near the beach where I came ashore on Idra,
It’s pretty derelict but it might serve well enough as a makeshift camp,
Markus the Chamberlain,
I met and spoke with the de-facto leader of the refugee camp north of Horryn,
Apparently the town has been overrun by crazed cultists,
"Worse, the city-gates are apparently sealed making it impossible to get back in",
For now my energy might be well spent trying to ease the plight of the refugees,
Smuggler's Cache,
I found an abandoned smuggler's cache in one of the Caves on Idra,
Perhaps there are more like it to be found on the Outer Isles?,
The Wreck Picker,
I met a strange old wreck picker by the name of Basilo,
"Though I should be careful in trusting him, he has offered to buy any scrap I find on the beach",
I can find him in an old farm house north of where I landed on Idra,
The Zephyr,
Apparently the wreck of the Zephyr has shifted enough in the tides that it is now possible to enter it,
#Chapter 2,
Oleg's Plan,
I told Oleg that the Butcher has gotten hold of his unholy tablets,
The news caused the old chieftain to decide to attempt to end the Butcher,
"I suspect that Oleg doesn’t stand a chance against him alone so perhaps I should ask the third chieftain, Kala, to side with Oleg?",
Together they might be able to take down the Butcher,
Oleg the Gray is Dead,
The Reaver chief Oleg the Gray is dead,
Oleg's Right to Rule,
I met one of the three Reaver chieftains,
Oleg,
He’s the oldest of the three and claims to hold ‘sacred’ tablets that gives him the right to rule over his siblings; Kala and the Butcher,
He’s asked me to seek them out and remind them of that fact,
Queen Kala is Dead,
The Reaver chief 'queen' Kala is dead,
The Butcher is Dead,
The Reaver chief known as 'the Butcher' is dead,
The Reaver Tablets,
I gave the Reaver Tablets to the Butcher,
He now intends to make an offering of Oleg as part of his ascent to Father's side,
He's asked me to go tell Kala he wants her at his side for the final slaughter,
The Butcher's Designs,
I met the Reaver chieftain that calls himself “The Butcher,
He’s determined to win the favor of the one the Reavers call Father by subjugating his siblings,
Oleg and Kala,
For starters he’s asked me to steal a pair of unholy tablets that are currently in the possession of Oleg,
They are being kept in tunnels under Oleg's lodge in the east end of town,
There is apparently a secret entrance to them if I “don’t mind wading through shit,
The Waif,
I met a young girl in the ruins of Horryn and managed to win her trust with some food,
She has proven quite resourceful and has successfully managed to evade the Reavers,
It turns out she had quite a bit of information about them,
She’s currently hiding in an alley west of the plaza,
A Strange Growth,
I came across a strange fungus growing on some of the fresh corpses in the crypt under the Horryn temple,
It’s difficult to say what it is but is seems to be out of place there,
Joran the Usurper,
A strange and ancient creature clings to undeath in the bowels of the catacombs under Horryn,
The hateful creature will not rest until I bring it the sword of “Joran the Usurper,
I wonder if this usurper could be buried in one of the other tombs in this catacomb,
Main Gate Opened,
The main gate of Horryn is now opened!,
Sea-Gate Open,
The Horryn sea-gate is now opened!,
The Art Dealer,
An art-dealer down in the Underhalls beneath Horryn is looking to buy strange and unusual artifacts if I find any,
Reaver Cellar,
A pair of Reavers appeared to be guarding something in the cellar under Olge’s lodge,
#Chapter 3,
To Find a Ship,
We must find a ship willing to take us to Gradla,
Markus the chamberlain suggests I seek out the smugglers that are rumored to be holed up in a cave north-west of Horryn,
That would place it somewhere near the location 66 by 91 on the Outer Isles map,
We must find a ship willing to take us to Gradla and I think the ship and crew hiding in the sea-caves north-west of town is likely my best bet,
The cave is located at position 66 by 91 on the Outer Isles map,
Horryn is Saved,
I managed to storm the keep in Horryn and stamp out the last remnants of the Reavers,
"Though hundreds are dead and the city in ruins, Horryn appears to be safe for now",
Iago Rejoins his Crew,
Iago has gone ahead to rejoin his crew and begin preparations for us to sail for Gradla,
He awaits us up in a large sea-cave at position 66 by 91 on the Outer Isles map,
That should make it north-west of Horryn,
#Chapter 4,
Colony Collapse,
I found several dead or dying bee-hives in Firgol,
It seems the bees there are fighting amongst each other,
Firgol Bees,
"Despite assurances that ‘Firgol bees do not sting’, I found the bees in one of the hives to be quite aggressive",
I may need to find some way of pacifying them if I am going to get at the honey,
Trapped Mine Tunnel,
I’ve rigged one of the tunnels in the mine at Adler’s Helm to collapse,
The trap can be triggered by using a rope to pull away the remaining support-beam and I’m certain it could be done rapidly if need be,
The False Tomb,
I found and opened the sarcophagus in the Priory catacombs central tomb-chamber,
"Surprisingly, it turns out to be empty!",
A decoy perhaps?,
The Gong,
I performed a ritual using the gong outside the tomb chamber,
I have a strong feeling it was correctly performed though I cannot tell exactly to what purpose,
Perhaps some kind of trap was deactivated?,
Tunnels in the Dark,
I found a secret exit in the tomb-chamber that leads to tunnels engulfed by magical darkness,
I feel certain the way forwards lie through these tunnels though I must take care not to get lost in the dark as I attempt to navigate them,
The First Sarcophagus,
I found a sarcophagus under the Priory with the following description,
Carroleth of the Crystal Eye - First Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
The Second Sarcophagus,
Rothrax the Gray - Second Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
The Third Sarcophagus,
Kalamar the Wise - Third Grandmaster of the Order of the Crystal Eye,
The Ascension Chamber,
I found the chamber where Calipero’s apprentices go to “ascend” as a reward for their service,
"Grotesquely, the chamber appears to be nothing more than a crematorium",
Kill the Queen,
I found a strange queen in one of the hives,
I suspect it’s the cause of the collapse of the other colonies and so I quickly dispatched it,
Pilgrim's Shrines,
I found an old pilgrim’s shrine,
If I could somehow learn the proper prayers and rituals I could probably complete the pilgrimage myself if I wanted,
The Maiden Sets Sail,
We’ve taken to the high seas on the Weathermaiden,
"We must, however, stay close to shore lest we invoke the wrath of the behemoth that stalks the deeper seas of the Outer Isles",
#Chapter 5,
A Language of Pure Logic,
I managed to somehow become attuned to the language of the great machine inside the ancient structure,
