#Main Quests,,,
A Twilight Meeting,,,
I’ve been summoned to the estate of the lord Cato Berryn,,,
My father’s old patron,,,
"Though I grew up here, I’ve not been back for decades due to the unfortunate manner in which my father left the service of House Berryn",,,
I do not know why Cato summons me now and I must venture to find out,,,
The lord Berryn has tasked me to find his daughter,,,
"My childhood friend, Embal",,,
Rescue Embla,,,
"My father's old patron, Lord Cato Berryn, has tasked me to rescue his daughter from the island of Idra",,,
She was last seen in the city of Horryn and I must search for clues as to her fate,,,
I found Embla in the town of Horryn,,,
Events have conspired however to make it impossible to return to the mainland,,,
Instead we must venture to end the madness that has engulfed the region,,,
This quest has failed,,,
Refugees of Horryn,,,
"Marcus the Chamberlain, the de-facto leader of the refugees, has pleaded with me to help the camp",,,
Food is running low and he’s requested I talk to Frantzo,,,
There is also a disease outbreak in camp and I should talk to Drahl the cleric about that,,,
Both can be found in the camp,,,
I’ve done what I can for the camp and the refugees have certainly been given a fighting chance,,,
Mouths to Feed,,,
"Frantzo, the camp’s cook and de-facto quartermaster, needs me to find food supplies for the refugees",,,
He needs a large supply of it and soon as people have begun dying from starvation,,,
I’ve provided the Frantzo with the food he needs to keep the refugees fed for the foreseeable future,,,
Jakub's Goats,,,
Frantzo suggests looking into the farmer’s missing herd of goats,,,
He suspects the farmer hid them away to keep them from being eaten by starving refugees,,,
Bring the Goats to Camp,,,
I found Jakub's hidden goats up in a secluded mountain glen,,,
Now I must bring the herd of goats to the refugee camp,,,
If I don't get Jakub to agree first there may be consequences,,,
Convince Jakub,,,
Perhaps I should talk to Jakub and see if convince him to let me bring the goats back to camp,,,
"Jakub, the Idran goat farmer, has come to his senses and agreed to let me bring the goats to camp so they can be eaten",,,
He asks that I go and help his son,,,
Return to Frantzo,,,
I must return to Frantzo and tell him that I've brought Jakub's goats to camp,,,
Search for the Goats,,,
I need to start by looking for a clue as to where the herd could be located,,,
An Alternate Supply,,,
Look for an alternate solution to the food-crisis in the refugee camp,,,
Sea's Bounty,,,
The quartermaster of the Weathermaiden has enough food-supplies to feed the refugee camp,,,
The downside is it will cost me 500 pieces of gold,,,
I’ve acquired the food-supplies needed to feed the refugees,,,
Now all that remains is to return to Frantzo and tell him the good news,,,
Outbreak,,,
"There is an outbreak in camp and the aged cleric, Drahl, has asked me to help him look for a cure",,,
He suggests I start by talking to Hannah,,,
The mother of a sick child who appears to have a suggestion for a cure,,,
She can be found in a cottage south of camp,,,
I provided Drahl with a cure for the outbreak and it appears to be having the intended effect,,,
A Mother's Love,,,
A young mother in the refugee camp has pleeded with me to help save her child,,,
The boy's fallen ill and she begs me to seek out an old crone living in the forest in the islands interior,,,
She would know how to help,,как помочь,
"Though the old woman had gone insane, I was able to get medicine for the child",,,
I was unable to get medicine for Hannah in time,,,
Both mother and child passed,,,
"Having gotten his medicine, Hannah's boy is looking better already",,,
The Un-Born,,,
Mother Katak will help with the outbreak in camp,,,
"To make medicine she has asked me to find ""the un-born of the scaled ones""",,,
"Apparently they dwell nearby: ""north of the great oak and past the fetid pools""",,,
I recovered eggs from a pack of giant lizards and delivered them to the mad old hag,,,
You need to find 1 GiantLizardEgg,,,
You found GiantLizardEgg!,,,
The Eternity Gate,,,
I find myself naked and alone in the darkness,,,
I can only surmise I am inside the strange structure that we found underneath the Black Priory,,,
Truly this is a place where no mortal foot was ever meant to tread,,,
I am undone,,,
Dust in an endless void,,,
This will be my final entry,,,
The Zephyr,,,
"I need to investigate what is happening with ""The Zephyr",,,
A mutiny had broken out as the crew refused to bring the ship closer to Idra,,,
They claimed the island was cursed,,,
"The zephyr was sunk by a terrible, un-namable creature of the deep",,,
Plateau of Madness,,,
The Cabal expedition landed at the mining-village of Adler’s Helm,,,
I suspect we can find a way to ascend to the interior plateau on Gradla if we follow their trail to Adler's Helm and beyond,,,
"Following the ancient stairs discovered by the miners of Adler’s Helm, we have reached the interior plateau",,,
The Priory lies within reach,,,
Retaking Horryn,,,
"To retake Horryn, we must kill the three Reaver chiefs that occupy the city",,,

Alive,,,
Alive The Butcher,,,
Alive Queen Kala,,,
We have retaken the outer city,,,
Storming the Keep,,,
"Though we have liberated the outer city, Horryn’s keep remains in the possession of the Reavers",,,
The keep is well protected from a frontal assault so we need to look for an alternate entrance,,,
I successfully infiltrated the keep and slew the foul creature known as “Father,,,
The Secret Tunnel,,,
Hierophant Drahl believes a secret tunnel exists that connects the keep to the crypts underneath the temple,,,
The sacred crypts of the Sepulchites can be accessed from within the temple,,,
"Drahl suspects that if a secret tunnel does indeed exist, it probably lies in the deeper sections of the crypts",,,
"Though the crypt was overrun by foul undead creatures, we did indeed find the secret tunnel",,,
Talk to Drahl,,,
"According to Markus, Hierophant Drahl might know of a secret entrance into the keep",,,
The Hierophant can be found in front of the newly liberated temple,,,
I met and talked to the Hierophant,,,
Talk to Markus,,,
I’ve been told to meet Markus the Chamberlain at the inn that lies west of the city square in Horryn,,,
I suspect he has an idea about how to pierce the keep's defences,,,
I found and talked to Markus,,,
Untold Eons,,,
"We’ve penetrated the dungeons that lay beneath the Black Priory and entered into the black, timeless realms beyond",,,
Now it remains to be seen what untold secrets have lain hidden for so long,,,
We found what the Cabal was excavating underneath the Priory,,,
By the Golden how I wish we had let it lie in peace,,,
I fear there is no salvation for us now,,,
The Priory Opens,,,
We’ve entered the Black Priory,,,
"Whatever secrets the Cabal expedition found here, I suspect they lay beneath the priory",,,
We must find a way to enter the dungeon below,,,
We have breached the lower level of the priory,,,
To Sleep and Dream,,,
The secrets of the Priory are within reach,,,
We must navigate the catacombs and reach the great secret that lies at its heart,,,
May the Dead save us,,,
The secrets of this place are far deeper and more ancient than any of us could have guessed,,,
We descend now into a darkness from which I fear we’ll never re-emerge,,,
Upon Black Seas,,,
I rescued Embla but we find that there is no way to return to the main-land whilst the Outer Isles is engulfed in this madness,,,
Embla is convinced the calamity is somehow caused by the discovery of an ancient site known as “The Black Priory” on the island of Gradla,,,
Gradla is located to the north of Idra and we must find a ship and crew willing to take us there,,,
Gradla is within sight,,,
Now we must make landfall and seek a way to reach the inland plateau,,,
#Side Quests,,,
The Boar's Medicine,,,
Kydeon asked me fetch a bottle of brandy from the wine cellar under the kitchen after I talk to Lyra,,,
The old boar will sleep soundly tonight,,,
M' damn knees are acting up again,,,
Can't hardly sleep on account of the aches,,,
"Let me tell you, I'd take an arrow in the leg any day",,,
"If you're going over to the kitchen later for a bit of grub, a bottle of brandy from the wine-cellar would make me a happy man!",,,
Kydeon shifts as if to emphasize his stiff knees,,,
Ha!,,,
That's some fine foraging young whelp!,,,
"Before you can get a word in, Kydeon snatches the bottle, uncorks it and drinks deeply",,,

I failed to sneak into the hearth,,,

The lord of House Berryn is ready for me now,,,
An Evening Meal,,,
I have been ordered to go procure a meal for myself from the kitchen as there is no saying how long I will be waiting,,,
I should talk to the chef,,,
Chef Armand taught me to make his famous melted cheese sandwiches,,,
"Surely, old Magda cries in the tomb at what her kitchen has come to",,,
Chef Armand has offered to teach me how to make his famous cheese sandwich,,,
For starters I have to fetch cheddar cheese and cured ham from the cellar under the kitchen,,,
My suggestion is thusly,,,
"Whilst I stoke the fire, you run down in the pantry and fetch some cured ham and cheddar cheese",,,
I will then teach you how to cook my renowned melted cheese sandwich and you shall never want for an evening meal for as long as you live!,,,
The Hedge Maze,,,
Lyra suggests I should explore the hedge-maze in the villa grounds while I wait for master Cato to become ready,,,
"You managed to find ""Embla"" in the maze",,,
A Deeper Dark,,,
One of the lighthouse keepers went mad and killed himself after dreaming of a strange blade buried deep within the caves below the lighthouse,,,

It felt good to help,,,
Lost Sailors,,,
I met a small group of surviving sailors from the Zephyr camped near the wreck,,,
"Their de-facto leader, Snow, has asked that I send any survivors I find his way",,,
There should be at least 3 out there,,,
Found so far,,,
I sent those I could find to Snow’s camp,,,
"Though the group is still small, they certainly stand a better chance together than alone",,,
Sealed Away,,,
"Kat from the Zephyr, suggests we should look to see if the captain’s seal survived the sinking",,,
"Though the captain died on the Zephyr, one of the other crew-members might have managed to bring it ashore",,,
Kat suggests we start by examining a cave to the west,,,
The seal is apparently quite valuable and the Nautical Guild would pay well to have it returned,,,
We found the seal on one of the corpses in the cave,,,
I'll hold onto it and perhaps there is an opportunity to return it to the Nautical Guild if we ever make it back to the mainland,,,
Rescue Natia,,,
"Philip, a survivor from Horryn, has pleaded with me to try and rescue his wife Natia who is being dragged away the meet “The Father” inside the keep",,,

Julia is convinced her sister is worried about her safety considering last week’s events in Horryn,,,
She wants me to inform Ylia that she is safe given the circumstances,,,
I met Ylia and talked to her but the encounter left me none the wiser,,,
It seems Ylia is not only oblivious to the state of the Outer Isles,,,
She also insists that her sister was not late at all and was in fact due to arrive in a few days time,,,
I’m not sure what to make of this,,,

I should search for it,,,

On the back of the painting was a poem,,,

"Setting out to hide her booty, All within the lighthouse's sight",,,

He seems to be missing in the halls underneath the tower and the apprentices are desperate to see him returned,,,

Apparently the entrance will somehow reveal itself if I blow the silver flute given to me by the apprentices,,,
Salts of Elthanyr,,,
"As I entered the dungeon, I was contacted through magical means by Calipero himself",,,
It seems he is locked in an arcane stale-mate with some creature he tried to call forth from beyond,,,
To free himself he has asked that we create something called the Salts of Elthanyr and bring it to his summoning chambers beneath the main dungeon,,,

The area is off-limits and a guard patrols it,,,
"Once past the gate, I should make a left turn and find the chamber where the vomit cups grow",,,
"Afterwards, I’ll return to Esteban for my rewards as well as access to his alchemical supplies",,,
