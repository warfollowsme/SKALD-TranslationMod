#Map Meta-Data,
Firgol,
Before you lies a small village surrounded by fields and orchards,
The air is laden with the scent of fruit and the laughter of children and the pastoral bliss stands in stark contrast to the rest of the Outer Isles,
The Manor,
The Mines,
Adler's Helm,
Before you lies what appears to be closer to a fortified mining-camp than a town,
The most striking detail are the wrecks of abandoned ships that lie just outside the town’s harbor,
Horryn,
The Underhalls,
Horryn Castle,
The Crypt,
Horryn Sewers,
The Womb,
Walls of Horryn,
"At the end of the rugged peninsula lies the small, walled fishing village of Horryn",
"Once home to hundreds, the town now lies seemingly deserted",
"Whatever fate has befallen this place, you must be on you guard if you choose to enter it",
The Coastal Pass,
The Deep Forest,
"Besides the buzzing of insects and croaking of toads, the forest is disconcertingly quiet",
The foliage seems to thin slightly in this area and to the north-east you can make out a faint wisp of smoke rising from a chimney,
"The foliage does however, seem to thin slightly in this area and to the north-east you can make out a faint wisp of smoke rising from a chimney",
Forest Caves,
The Hidden Glen,
A hidden glen nestled between two mountains,
"Had you not known to look for it, you would have easily missed it",
Shores of Idra,
Ahead of you lies the windswept shore where you landed on Idra and the abandoned farmsteam,
The Foul Caves,
Lighthouse Exterior,
An ancient lighthouse rises steeply from the bluffs ahead of you,
"The beacon is still lit, though it flickers weakly",
Under the Lighthouse,
Lighthouse,
Refugee Camp,
"Before you, the unmistakable mess, squalor and desperation of a refugee camp sprawls around a small farmstead like a festering wound",
Coastal Road,
Sea-Caves,
"A huge sea-cave, created by eons of the sea’s relentless attack on the rock, gapes in the cliffs ahead",
"If you take great care, a narrow trail allows you to enter it",
Wreck Site,
Broken bodies and debris litter the rocky shores of Idra,
"In the distance, you can make out what appears to be the remains of the Zephyr's hull",
Wreckage,
The Berryn Estate,
The Cellar,
The Outer Isles,
Outer Isles,
Excavation Site,
Priory Crypt,
The Black Priory,
A grim edifice rises from the wastelands,
"Its walls are weatherbeaten and its empty windows glare at you like dead, black eyes",
"Abandoned as it may seem, there is nevertheless some siren call that bids you venture inside… and below",
The Eternity Gate,

A Twisted Forest,
A Field,

#String Lists,
Welcome!,
Have a seat!,
I'll be with you in a moment!,
Hi there!,
Hic,
I'm cold,
Spare a coin?,
So hungry,
My insides hurt,
Should you be here?,
Don't tell me you've an audience?,
"Charmed, I'm sure",
Hm?,
There are mercenaries on the island that don't belong here,
Rumors have it they are encamped on the Priory grounds,
I have no idea why they're here but they have to have something to do with what's happening,
I don't believe the farmer's goats are dead!,
I heard someone say she saw the famer's son drive the animals into the mountains when Horryn fell,
How can he hide away food while we starve?,
"Governor spent more time out at his estate, east of here than at his offices in Horryn!",
"He's probably dead now though, and good riddance to him!",
They say smugglers use the caves in the mountains to the west,
Maybe they have food?,
Ships came to the island a few weeks ago,
"They didn't dock in Horryn, but sailed up towards the Priory",
Maybe they managed to land there?,
Though I don't know how,
The northern coast is all steep cliffs and rocks,
The fishermen began seeing 'something' in the oceans a few weeks ago,
Then the boats started disappearing!,
Now we're trapped here!,
Just waiting to die!,
When is the Empire coming for us?,
How can they even know something is wrong?,
"And if they did, they say a horror stalks the seas around Horryn!",
I'm not sleeping well,
My dreams,
They are,
"Ugh, why am I telling you this?",
We're defenceless sitting here!,
And where is the governor and the guards?,
Dead I suppose,
People have started to get sick,
Just look at poor Hannah's boy,
Thank you for finding food,
I'm so hungry,
All those people lost,
What's happening to us?,
Do you have any food?,
I feel better,
Ugh,
Feels like the world's ending!,
Leave me alone,
Please help us!,
These caves are beginning to wear on me,
I wish we could get out of here soon,
Hold on... did you hear something?,
Have you been to see the queen yet?,
Freythens or Imperials,
I don't care 's long as the coin is good!,
Sitting on a cargo like this is making me nervous,
Hope we get out to sea again soon!,
They say the world's ending out there,
I don't care - I just want to get out of here!,
"In our line of work, strangers are bad news",
Keep away from me or we'll have words,
Mommy!,
I want to go home!,
I don't want to be here!,
I'm afraid!,
I want my mommy!,
I can't wait for Carnivale!,
I'm so excited!,
I'm going to eat so much cake!,
Tihi!,
Are you going to Carnivale?,
Wanna play?,
Is it Carnivale now?,
My head hurts,
I'm afraid of the dark,
Gahhh!,
Cough,
I have bad dreams,
Wee!,
Carnivale!,
I want more cake!,
Honey-cake is the best!,
Greetings m'lord,
Greetings m'lady,
Hello,
I'm excited for the Carnivale,
The Baron is a good man!,
Have you tried the local cider?,
Firgol is such a peaceful place,
You saved us!,
What happened?,
"Thank the Golden, the children are safe!",
I don't really sleep anymore,
Nightmares are back,
My head hurts!,
I feel sick!,
Hi,
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers,
You look strange,
My stomach hurts,
Do you have nightmares too?,
Good to be back,
Hello there m'lord,
Hello there m'lady,
M'lord,
M'lady,
How could this happen?,
What's next?,
The stench,
"Ugh, I'm hungry",
What?,
My knee,
I used to be an adventurer,
I’ve got my eye on you!,
No funny business!,
Hmm?,
It’s good to have the Captain back!,
I wonder what happened to the Captain?,
I can't wait to set sail!,
I could do with some rum!,
How long do we have to stay here?,
Burp,
You look like a landlubber!,
Farewell and adieu to ye ladies of Vauul,
"They say practice makes perfect, and maybe they’re right; it seems all those hours spent honing your skills are starting to pay off",
"Keep it up, and soon you’ll be well on your way to mastery!",
Did this stuff used to be difficult?,
"You cannot remember, for right now, you are quickly becoming one of the best in your field",
Your progress seems to have slowed to a frustrating crawl,
"Alas, shuffling forward is always better than standing still",
"How foolish you were, to think yourself at the top of your game",
"If your journey so far has taught you anything, it is that there is always someone better, someone stronger",
"The question is not if you are strong enough to beat them, but if you are strong enough to try",
Giving up has never been an option,
But perhaps a long bath and a good meal wouldn’t go amiss,
"Your latest trials have left you exhausted, yet the perseverance it has taken to push on has left you stronger than ever",
"But despite this victory, a single thought plagues you: how much more can you push until there is nothing left?",
"No one can make it through this world alone, and lately you find yourself thinking of those who have helped you on your journey",
"Perhaps one day, when this is all over, you can find a way to repay them",
The person you were when you began this journey is now nothing but a distant memory,
"You are irrevocably changed, and no matter what comes next, you will never be who you once were",
You’ve spent countless hours forging yourself into the person you are today,
Now all that’s left to do is the hardest thing of all: trust in yourself,
"Soon your journey will be at its end, and though victory is nigh, you cannot help but wonder: what will it cost?",
"For the first time in your life, you are overcome with a sense of purpose",
"The path ahead will undoubtedly be difficult, but you are certain it is the one you are supposed to take",
"You have mastered all that you have set your mind to, yet the sweetness of your victory is tainted by the knowledge that once you have reached the top, there is nowhere else to go but down",
"Every step forward is worth celebrating, no matter how small",
"Keep going, and soon the path behind you will be longer than the path ahead",
You can feel yourself growing stronger with every trial you face,
"Each adventure leaves you just a little faster, a little braver",
What more are you capable of?,
Adrenaline floods your veins,
"The tasks that once seemed so difficult now come naturally to you, leaving you with an insatiable urge to learn something new",
The possibilities ahead of you seem as endless as your potential - who knows what adventures lay ahead?,
Who knew the human body was capable of such feats?,
"You can feel yourself changing, the layers of your old self shedding away into something new",
Something better,
"It amazes you how each adventure manages to present you with a new challenge, reminding you that there is always something more to learn",
Each dawn is a new chance to perfect your skills,
"You’re not sure you’ve ever worked this hard for anything before, and you’re not about to give up now",
Greeting brother!,
Greeting sister!,
Do you think we'll get off this island?,
I really wanted to see the shrines,
Haven't we been tested enough?,
A blessing upon you!,
Huh?,
We have the word from the deep!,
Bow your head before before our chieftain!,
The fuck you want?,
Look at me funny and I'll gut you!,
Hhhh,
Ahhh,
Gahhh,
Mhhhh,
Steel Thyself!,
Draw Steel!,
Make Ready!,
Death or Glory!,
To the Last!,
Blood Will Flow!,
It’s good to be sailing again!,
Aye?,
Seasick?,
Found your sea legs?,
