Concept,
The To-Hit roll is made by comparing the Attacker's Attack Roll to the Defender's Defence Roll,
If the Attacker rolls equal to or higher than the Defence Roll the attack is a hit,

2d6 + Melee To Hit / Ranged To Hit + Misc,
Bonuses + Accuracy Bonuses,
2D6,
Simulates rolling and adding up two six-sided dice,
In other words a 2d6 roll generates a number between 2 and,
DEFENCE ROLL,
The Defence Roll is,
2d6 + Misc Bonuses + Dodge,
Attribute - Defence,
The ability to avoid incoming attacks and other reflex-based dangers,
"In other words, this determines how hard a character is to hit",

Attribute - Combat,
The character's skill at attacking with melee weapons,
Determines hit chance,
RANGED TO HIT,
