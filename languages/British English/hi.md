# British English Translation Pack

Hi,

I'm the person who made the alterations to the script found within this pack.  
I hope you enjoy the game.

## Important Notice

If you come across any errors when playing, I am truly sorry: just remember that I did effectively edit an entire novella by myself, all free of charge; and that this is **many, many times better than the original!** For various reasons, it will likely always contain a small amount of oversights. I'll keep trying to do better.

### Known Limitations

Also, some of them may not be my fault. As it currently stands, not all the text in the game is able to be translated (you'll notice that a `need_translate` text file is generated to this affect), and some of the text displays differently in the game itself compared to the translation spreadsheet. 

For example:
- Some ability data 
- Some ends of sentences
- Particularly some punctuation at the end of sentences, which is added in by the game afterwards and is stored elsewhere

Until I get around to playing the entire game again; to reading every piece of text as it is displayed, there will be some errors. Perhaps in the future this will be rectified.

## Changes Made

Preamble aside, whilst attempting to preserve the original work as much as possible, here are the changes you can expect to see:

### Grammar and Spelling
- Fixed spelling and grammar errors and on the whole improved punctuation (lots of commas added!)

### British English Conventions
- Altered spellings to British conventions (*traveller*, *colour*, *centre*, etc)
- Edited all hyphenated words to be more conventional - which contrary to what is typical for British English actually meant removing many
- Altered anything I considered a gross Americanism to a British equivalent (e.g. '*real good*' to '*really good*')
- Altered some of the speaking dialogue to be more idiomatically British, without making the vernacular so strong that it cannot be understood by a wider audience

### Punctuation Consistency
- Attempted to make all punctuation regarding and surrounding quotations consistent
- Because the game generates quotation marks (`"`) by itself, I chose to use these as the primary marks for quotations and apostrophes (`'`) for contained quotations
- Even if this is contrary to some British English standards, I'd rather it be consistent
- This will likely be the greatest inconsistency until I play through the game again

### Content Improvements
- Altered a few lines to provide additional context or clarity where potentially ambiguous text tended to cause uncertainty in some users
- Added some other literary or cultural references to the text

### Future Plans
I would like to add more literary references in the future, especially:
- **Monty Python**
- **Tolkien** 
- **Other British works**

But they require much more effort than just skimming the text for errors, and they often deviate too much from the original work to be reasonable. For now, there are only a couple. *Enjoy the Shakespeare references, should you notice.*

## Final Thoughts

And that's about it. I probably could have re-written vast swathes of the text to be in my own literary style, but I decided against it; and even if many of the lines remain unaltered, I still had to read every single one and decide what best to do with it!

**Thanks.**
